DR RAMASHALA:

Thank you, to facilitate your statements the Chairperson, Ms Mary Burton,
will help along, Chairperson.

MS BURTON:

Thank you Dr Ramashala, I once again welcome to all of you here. Ms
Mangaliso youíre going to start to tell this very important story this
afternoon and weíre very grateful to you for coming to tell what you
witnessed and the very tragic death of your next-door neighbour,
Mandlenkosi Kratshi in January of 1985. So will you please tell us what
happened when you began to hear what was going on

next-door?

MS MANGALISO:

Tshaka Mandlenkosi Kratshi was my neighbour, then it was early in the
morning just before 8 oíclock and we were both standing because his home
was not very distant from mine, because our houses at the location are
crowded. We were standing behind the house and he was standing there and
I asked him whether the policemen had not come again, because they had
come earlier on to look for him.

Then he said no they had not come and he went into the house because he
was cooking porridge in the house and there was - Simphiwe was standing
next to him. And I think he was 7 years old at the time, whilst standing
there where I was there came two police van and two policemen came - four
policemen came out of the vans. They were Vermeulen, Moodey, Dan and De
Villiers - they went into Tshakaís home and I was watching and Dan asked
Tshaka in Xhosa why he had not come when they had actually called for
him. Then he asked why they had called for him, whilst sitting there
watching I saw the door being closed.

I ran round to come and stand just before the gate and I could see
Simphiwe standing afar next to another yard and I could hear sounds of
them beating him. I could hear that they were beating him, then I
screamed. There were other people around but I couldnít tell who those
people were. We were crying and Vermeulen threw tear gas at us, I ran
away to my house because my sister liked doing washing, then there were
two baths there outside and then I dipped my face into this bath of water.

And I went back to where I was standing before, as I was standing I could
see that the door was open and Tshaka was standing at the door. He was
bleeding and there was blood running down his neck. And he looked very
tired, I again went round - there were other people who had joined me now
and De Villiers was standing outside. Some two other policemen were
remaining there and Vermeulen had been standing outside all the time.
Then I heard De Villiers in Afrikaans saying: Give way, let me shoot this
pig. And I heard this sound - it - the - the gun that he used was not the
usual gun that has got a loud sound. I then looked at Tshaka and he was
staggering - staggering - staggering and he ultimately fell next to the
door, facing downwards.

We screamed, crying and more and more people came to the scene. And I
donít know who brought information to the school and Themba came and
asked who had shot Tshaka. I was still crying and then I pointed at the
person who had shot Tshaka. After that there never was happiness in the
location. Some other police vans came and an ambulance to came and they
took out a stretcher and they took Tshaka onto the stretcher, but we
could make out that he was dead. Because when they left they had - his
body was covered with a blanket.

Then they left with his body and in the location there never was
happiness after that. Until he was buried, even after his funeral there
was no happiness what so ever. I pause.

MS BURTON:

Thank you Ms Mangaliso, I know it was not easy for you, you told me that
this is the first time youíve told a story in public. And weíre grateful
to you for coming, this is - this - we have heard earlier today of how
Tshaka was well known as a leader and how other young people were in fact
beaten for wearing a T-shirt with his name on it.

And itís clear that he was a major influence in the area. I think I will
ask now if we can hear what Simphiwe remembers from that time. Perhaps
you could all move up a little bit, it might be easier than trying to
move the microphone. If you could just all move your chairs a little bit
more towards the edge of the stage. Halo Simphiwe, welcome here today.

MR KRATSHI:

I also great you maíam.

MS BURTON:

You were a very little boy - you were 7 years old - when this happened.
Would you like to tell us what you remember?

MR KRATSHI:

Yes, I would like to tell you. It was in the morning and I was preparing
to go to school, I was very hungry because I was from my grandmotherís
place. Then I decided not to go to school first, Iíve went to my father
first and I told him that I was hungry - I had to eat before getting to
school.

So my father tried to cook porridge for me and police came to him and
they told him - they asked him why he would not come to them if they had
asked him to come to them. Then he said he was going to come to them but
he was still cooking porridge. Then the policemen who - would not except
that - they felt that they have been calling him several times and then
the policemen would not listen to his explanation.

They forced him to leave what he was doing and go with them and he said
he could not leave me hungry as I was, because I was going to school. He
had to prepare porridge and then they did not allow that he should
continue. They started touching him and my father took a fork and stabbed
them with the fork and they punched at him. Then the police went out of
the house and I saw one white policeman, a Boer, taking out a gun and
advancing for my father. And he shot just once and he fell down and he
never recovered up to today - I end there.





MS BURTON:

Will you - will you tell us what the effect of your fathers death has had
on you and other members of you family?

MR KRATSHI:

It has brought a great changes to me. It has really effected me, so I am
unsuccessful in many things - Iím just doing some things thatís out of
order. Thereís no one to help me because he would be helping me if he was
still alive. So many things have affected me from all over.

MS BURTON:

Thank you, thank you, well you have a roll model to try to follow in your
- in your family and we give you our sympathy that you lost your father
at such a very young age. I would just like - before asking you anything
else - if you - if thereís anything else you want to say, to read to you
something of what I - Research Department have told us about what was
happening at the time.

In 1984 the African Township of Beaufort West had a population of
approximately 7,000 consisting of hundreds of chanteys and approximately
600 houses. 11 taps and 16 public toilets served the entire community. On
the 9th of December 1984 the black youth of Beaufort West called a mass
meeting at which the Zanokhanyo Youth Organisation - Zanokhanyo means
come with the light - was established. And the driving force behind the
Youth Organization was a dynamic organizer and dedicated political
activist, Mandlenkosi Tshaka Kratshi.

On the 22nd of January, as weíve heard, Mr Kratshi who was also a member
of the UDF in the Karoo, an executive member, was shot dead. Following
the shooting, residents gathered at the local community hall to discuss
the shooting. Numerous community councillors resigned

After police used tear gas to disperse the crowd outside a hall that
evening, an attempt was made to fire a bomb at policemanís home. The
house was gutted, but the policeman and his family were taken safely to a
secret address. Unconfirmed reports alleged that the home attacked
belonged to one of the policemen involved in the shooting of Mr Kratshi.

On Wednesday a second house was gutted and there was a total boycott of
classes on the 23rd of January at the Lower Primary School in the
township.

All political gatherings in the Magisterial District of Beaufort West
were banned for that weekend in terms of the Internal Security Act. The
funeral was held on the 1st of February and went ahead in a ceremony
marked by discipline and restraint. The UDF and apparently the entire
black community of Beaufort West decided to comply with all the
provisions of an order by a Magistrate which prohibited freedom songs,
banners and speeches and effectively restricted the crowd to fewer that
300.

The people decided to plan the ceremony as a peaceful one and the word
went out that most would have to stay indoors. This was said by the Rev
Paul Oliver of the AME Church. The service was a very emotional one and
the township of Beaufort West was renamed KwaMandlenkosi in memory of Mr
Kratshi.

You are Mr Kratshi junior, is there anything else that you would like to
add to what youíve said to us already?

MR KRATSHI:

Yes, there is. One other thing I would like is that Iím suffering -
thereís no one to help me in this world. No one is helping me the way my
father was going to help me. Iím suffering in many things and I live with
my grandmother. My mother lives in Cape Town, I am a thief, I have got
cases for theft. When I want anything Iíve got to suffer in order to get
what ever I need.

MS BURTON:

We hear what you say Mr Kratshi and we will see what can be done to
council you in the coming future. We do believe that there are people
that support you, comrades of your fatherís and in your community who
will help you if you reach out a hand to them - their hands are there
ready to help you.

Ms Mangaliso is there something else that you would like to say to us. I
donít want to distress you any more, but I want to give you the chance if
you do want to say something.

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, there is maíam. It is true that Simphiwe - if perhaps the father was
still alive he would be of great help to him because at the time I wasnít
aware of this political struggles. And then their father to Simphiwe - he
used to politicize people and what hurt me mostly was that the late
Tshaka was the only son to his mother. His sister was a useless person,
so after Tshaka was shot his mother was left all by herself and after
some time the sister died to. So the mother is all by herself. We also
suffered a great loss as the community.

MS BURTON:

Thank you Ms Mangaliso, are you able to give us an address for Mr
Kratshiís mother so that we can investigate?

MS MANGALISO:

I donít know her address because here in the location we donít know the
addresses but I do know where she lives.

MS BURTON:

Thank you very much, weíll see what we can pursue. I donít have any other
questions, I donít know whether any of my colleagues do.

DR RAMASHALA:

My questions are for Simphiwe. You do not live at home right now?

MR KRATSHI:

No.

DR RAMASHALA:

You have a - in trouble quite a bit? And I think we hearing you saying
that you donít have a roll model and that in a sense you are raising
yourself - or you have raised yourself?

MR KRATSHI:

Itís like that maíam.

DR RAMASHALA:

How far did you go in school?

MR KRATSHI:

Iím now in Std 6.

DR RAMASHALA:

Are you in school right now?

MR KRATSHI:

Yes maíam.

DR RAMASHALA:

If you were to - to think about what you want to become, what can you
tell us?

MR KRATSHI:

There are many wishes I have.

DR RAMASHALA:

[indistinct]

MR KRATSHI:

I wish I could be an actor together with my friends - maybe we could come
out with something. Secondly my other wish is to be educated.

DR RAMASHALA:

How do you do at school?

MR KRATSHI:

My performance is very bad at school because I donít get any support - I
sometimes have to go to school in - an empty stomach and I donít have
much interest. In the morning I donít have food, then after school I also
donít have food to eat. Even what I learn at school I do not absorb well
because I always think where am I going to get food. My grandmother is a
pensioner.

DR RAMASHALA:

How are - how are you and Macholo living - youíre just living on
Macholoís pension, is that...[intervention]

MR KRATSHI:

Yes, itís like that.

DR RAMASHALA:

[indistinct]

MR KRATSHI:

Sheís not enjoying good health at all. She was not staying with us
because she used to be with the Boers and she only came back here today
to come and stay with us and she is not well.

DR RAMASHALA:

[indistinct]

MR KRATSHI:

Iím 17 years old.

DR RAMASHALA:

Thank you very much, any other questions? Is there anything else you want
to say? Ms Seroke.

MS SEROKE:

Simphiwe you say the fact that there is not one helping you like a
parent, has led you to do some wrong things. Could you just tell us of
these wrong you do which have put you into trouble.

MR KRATSHI:

Yes, I can explain because I also wish that I could have nice things and
I donít get any support from my grandmother. So this puts me into trouble
because when I see beautiful things I have this wish and then I just go
and take it and steel it without paying for it.

MS SEROKE:

And then in that way you get into trouble?

MR KRATSHI:

Yes.

MS SEROKE:

Now if your father was there supporting you, putting you into the right
track as he was an honorable person and respected person, it would mean
you wouldnít be in that trouble you are in?

MR KRATSHI:

Yes, itís like that.

MS SEROKE:

Thank you.

ADV POTGIETER:

Ms Mangaliso there was an inquest into the death of Mr Kratshi. Did the
police ever take a statement from you?

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, there was a statement that was taken from me which was after a long
time because when the policemen asked for this statement from me, I was
working for the Wimpy and I used to run away from them because I got a
word that I should not give a statement to the police before I see the
lawyers.

I remember one day at work I had already told my co-workers that if the
police come they should not point at me and say Iím the one. Then it
happened, one friend of mine and I was going to work that time in the
afternoon and she called me - Evelin - that I should come to her. Then I
asked whoís looking for me and when I came closer I could see there was a
policeman taking at - standing at the door.

Then I decided to move back and hide and I ran round the corner and went
into the Reall Hotel. And I asked for clothes and some doeks, then I left
my uniform there and put on this clothes and went to the location. I
found this Special Branch people there at my home and after I had given
my statement to the lawyers I thereafter gave the Special Branch people
my statement.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] according to our records the inquest was held on 25th of
October in 1985. Now, the statement that you gave to the police, was that
before the inquest was held in the Magistrates Court here in Beaufort
West?

MS MANGALISO:

I gave my statement before that but I canít remember what month it was
but it was before the 15th of October.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] to come to Court and to come and talk about what happened
when Mr Kratshi was killed?



MS MANGALISO:

Yes, I went to Court and I did go.

ADV POTGIETER:

I understand it [indistinct] to give evidence at Court?

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, they said I should give evidence in Court and tell them what I had
seen.

ADV POTGIETER:

Did you [indistinct] or what?

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, I did that.

ADV POTGIETER:

And did you tell the court exactly like youíve explained to us now what
happened on that day?

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, I told them everything there but here Iím in a relaxed mood and
there I was nervous because it was the first time for me to stand in
court. I told them about the killer De Villiers who said: Let us kill
this pig.

ADV POTGIETER:

And apart from yourself did anybody else who also saw what happened there
give evidence?

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, there were other people - two of them who gave evidence but one of
them the lawyer said and I donít know whether he was for the state or for
the complainant. He said to me that I was the one who went about telling
people who was the killer of De Villiers. Because he said the other
witness did not say that.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] these other people that you speak about are they also from
the township or are they police - police people?

MS MANGALISO:

They are residents in the location.

ADV POTGIETER:

And the - this Mr De Villiers do you know where he is now?

MS MANGALISO:

I donít know much about his whereabouts but a friend of mine - Nora - who
looks very much like me and once lived in George that year, said she met
Mr De Villiers and Mr De Villiers thought it was me and asked her: Have
you come to point me. And he said he wanted to meet him in one road and
he did think of it that we looked alike and perhaps De Villiers was
mistaking her for me. And so she did not go there.

ADV POTGIETER:

So it could be that he is in George?

MS MANGALISO:

Yes maybe.

ADV POTGIETER:

Can I also just ask you Ms Mangaliso from what you saw there, was there
any reason for the policeman De Villiers to - to shoot Mr Kratshi?



MS MANGALISO:

According to what I observed there was absolutely no reason why De
Villiers shot Kratshi because it - Mr De Villiers wanted Mr De Villiers
to go to the police station he could have easily done so, because there
were four of them. And they could have forced him if they really wanted
him, according to what they said. There was absolutely no reason why he
shot him.

ADV POTGIETER:

Thank you very much.

DR RAMASHALA:

Ms Mangaliso this question is for you. You witnessed a horrendous act,
Iím just wandering what the impact of all of this has been on you. Your
health, your emotions, even your sleeping patterns?

MS MANGALISO:

There are a lot of changes like I now have develop a tendency of
begrudging people and I am nervous and I donít feel comfortable.

MS SEROKE:

All right, [indistinct]

MS MANGALISO:

Yes, Iím quite well.

MS SEROKE:

Nonceba after youíd given your statement about the killing of Mr Kratshi
did

De Villiers try to ill treat you about that?





MS MANGALISO:

No, he did not but I could see that where ever she - he saw me because I
was working at the Wimpy and he was not aware and one time he came with
his wife and I was not in for a short while. Then I heard some people
calling me from that caf… and I went into the Wimpy and I stood next to
the self-serve and he was just about to eat but as soon as he saw my face
he wouldnít eat. And then the wife asked whey he was bothering himself
about all that and not eat and then he said to the wife: Hurry up so that
we can leave. So he left without eating his food because he had seen my
face.

MS SEROKE:

Since you were a neighbour to Mr Kratshi and who also was the eye witness
of this killing, is there any help you could offer if you were to get
some money as to help Simphiwe and the grandmother. Since you were people
who had been neighbours who were in good relations together with this
family?

MS MANGALISO:

You mean it money could be available, yes a lot. Especially to Simphiwe
because my wishes are that Simphiwe should be like his father. We are not
trying to buy favor by saying that his father was a good man.

MS BURTON:

Iím going to ask Dr Ramashala to thank you both then for coming to talk
to us today.

DR RAMASHALA:

When the live of a young child is changed, it does something to me. Mr
Mangaliso - Ms Mangaliso let me start with you and say it is not very
frequent when a neighbour stands up even to scream to provide assistance
for a neighbour. You took a chance by screaming when the police were
beating on your neighbour, Mr Kratshi. I think that today you show your
concern about asking for assistance for Simphiwe. In fact what comes
across is that you regard him as your own son.

To Simphiwe Iíd like to say when everybody elseís child in South Africa
was going to school, African children were dying in the streets on the
way to school, on the way back from school. In your case, Simphiwe, you
lost your father, your roll model, your supporter and like most of the
children whoís parents perished in the struggle in South Africa, you were
left without that close support.

You have stated yourself how this has affected you, we are unable to
determine what tomorrow could have been for you. Maybe today but we are
hoping that tomorrow will be a little better for you. I know you sound
like you despair, I know it seems like since your fatherís death nobody
cares and I know you think that your live is like a treadmill, may I say
that you are only 17 and that this is a new South Africa and in my
fantasy with new opportunities.

It is not a disgrace to go back to school at the age of 17 even to go
back to standard 6. I think you should raise your horizons, you donít
have a father yes, but you have the support of the greater South African
community. I think you need to look to South Africa - your great
community to provide you with assistance so that you can realize your
dreams. I personally would like to say weíre going to explore
possibilities for counseling for you so that we can rid you from that
despair.

I know youíre wondering and saying why me, why did I loose my father,
there are thousands of children like you in South Africa who lost their
fathers and their mothers. If I can just give you a little bit of hope
and say that we are going to carry forward this recommendations and be a
part of your live from today. And see if we could touch you just that
little bit to make a difference, thank you very much.

MS BURTON:

Thank you, you can leave the stage now.

That brings us to the end of the cases that we are to hear today and in
Beaufort West. We have heard in these past two days many accounts of
pain, of ongoing suffering and indeed sometimes of much anger. Weíve
heard of the long term effects on peopleís lives and on those of their
families. Lives disrupted, families damaged, childrenís futures blighted
and employment denied to people, sometimes on suspicion that they were
politically involved.

Yes, we live in a new and changed society and there are new rolls for
people - we think of Mr Lolwana and his roll now as a Deputy Mayor, but
weíve seen that there are old wounds with barely healed scares.

We heard the stories of elderly men, who after more that 20 years still
carry the mental and physical damage that they suffered. And we have
heard of ongoing conflict in some places where people somehow have
managed to go on living together even after dreadful experiences. But
true reconciliation seems far out of reach.

Weíve heard much anger directed at members of the police and it must be
very difficult for members of the SAPS, especially those who are working
here to protect us in this hall, to listen to all of this. Itís difficult
too for people who have suffered to see those who caused them suffering
in all the time that we have heard from in these last two days, seeing
those people who hurt them continue to occupy position of responsibility.

Now I think Iím right in saying that all of the stories we have heard
stem from - except for the - the member from Victoria West, who told us
about events there in the 60ís - the other cases all come from the period
of the State of Emergency. And it was very interesting to me to see that
some people were detained on the 12th of June of 1986. If I remember
correctly that was the date of the proclamation of the National State of
Emergency. So one has the sense that there was a feeling that now with
the provisions of the State of Emergency it is possible to act against
people no longer abiding by the term of the rule of law.

And perhaps thatís one of the lessons that we have to learn that we never
again want a situation where people can act with impunity and have people
in their power because that leads to dreadful deeds. We have somehow to
try and understand even then how and why things happened. I think that
the - the policemen who was found to have shot Mr Kratshi was 23 years
old at the time. What happened to young people to make them behave like
that, how can we understand what was in the minds and hearts of people
who were so fearful of the resistance ranged against us - against them,
that they acted in that way.

I believe that part of our task as Truth and Reconciliation Commission is
to help us all so to try and understand one another that we can get over
the deep gulfs. ÖEND OF TAPE 4, SIDE BÖ
