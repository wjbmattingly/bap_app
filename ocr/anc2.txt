Manifesto:



Nature of the South African Conflict

The TRC has asked the ANC to make a statement on our "views, motivations
and perspectives on the nature of the South African conflict. (...) What
were the values that inspired the leaders of your organisation over the
years? (...) What inspired the sacrifices which many of your followers
made? What drove those who (...) were responsible for the commission of
violations (of human rights)?" 

In stating its views on the nature of past conflict, the ANC seeks to
promote the objectives for which the Commission for Truth and
Reconciliation was established. We do so keenly aware that if nursed and
not lanced, the boil of past conflict will fester in our body politic,
slowly infecting it and finally possibly destroying the nascent democracy.

The liberation of South Africa has come with pain: pain of the victims of
colonial policies that decreed the majority of South Africans sub-human;
and pain of the victims of an ideology that could not be sustained
forever because it was inherently iniquitous - thus forcing its
proponents and its beneficiaries, like humans possessed, to resort to
brute force in defence of the indefensible.

At the root of South Africa's conflict was the system of colonial
subjugation. Like other colonial countries, South Africa was victim to
the rapacious licence of an era that defined might as right; an epoch of
an international morality that justified dispossession and turned owner
into thief, victim into aggressor, and humble host into ungodly infidel.

And so history was re-recorded in the image of the mighty, seeking to
persuade the subjugated that they were fortunate beneficiaries of
philanthropy; occasional victims of a well- intentioned experiment gone
awry; a hapless people who should be thankful that, because only a few
million among them were being killed and because they were experiencing
population growth, a crime against humanity was not being committed.

Such was the system of apartheid, a natural continuation of this
rapacious licence.

It defined those of our fellow South Africans from Europe, who had chosen
to settle in this country, as superior human beings, with the right to
lord it over others; and with the holy writ to declare all but 13% of the
land the court of the upper caste, in which their fellow human beings
should be temporary sojourners, humbly to serve and to obey.

It fashioned a basic law of the land whose mission was to protect the
ill-gotten privileges of the chosen few: with the land and the riches in
its bowels, and the flora and fauna of its beautiful landscapes, the
property of a white minority that had the sole prerogative to make laws
and to choose the government of the day.

The cry of desperation of the majority and the hunger pangs of their
children were the fodder upon which fed the laughter and comfort of the
tormentors.

And the state - the army, the police, the civil service, the judiciary,
and other organs - were built and rebuilt to serve the master and protect
their privileges.

With each passing phase, new constitutions, new laws, new proclamations,
new regulations, new orders were issued to keep the kaffir, the hotnot
and the coolie in their place. And force became the stock-in-trade to
maintain and defend injustice.

Where new constitutions, new laws, new proclamations, new regulations and
new orders failed, the architects of apartheid legality themselves worked
to subvert their own writ: to electrocute their captives to death, to
throw bodies into rivers, to shoot and blow bodies up, to murder children
and their mothers in their sleep, to kill their own in order to discredit
the enemy, and to dispose of those among themselves who dared to question
even a single deed.

Such was apartheid: a crime against humanity.

Yet it would have been nature gone berserk, had the subjugated accepted
their station without protest, without resistance, without struggle and
indeed without war.

It is the decree of millennia, that an oppressed people will rise to
reclaim what is rightfully theirs, precisely because they are not less
than human.

South Africans were no exception.

Their humanity accorded them the natural right to revolt; their sense of
justice obliged them to stand up and seek a system where all could be
equal before the law, and where all could have the right to determine
their destiny.

It is this humanity that infused the oppressed with the conviction that
"South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white." And it is
the trust in the humanity of others which fed their humility, for half a
century, to write petitions, to march, to gather, to refuse to obey
unjust laws, to withdraw their labour, to boycott puppet
institutions...but not to lift a finger in retaliation.

But alas, it came to pass that their humanity was met by sub-human deeds
in the name of a self-declared superiority.
And thus ranged against one another, in intensifying conflict, were the
oppressor and the oppressed, the owners of the wealth of the country and
the dispossessed, the rightless and the privileged.

The ANC was a product of this history and this conflict, not their
creator. It was born out of the desire of a proud people that sought
dignity and justice in the land of their birth.

Its historic mission was and remains to give expression to these desires
of the majority of South Africans. It led their peaceful protests, and
when the avenues for such protest were closed, it took up arms to achieve
the same objectives. To do otherwise would have been to acquiesce and
indeed, by omission, to help perpetuate a crime against humanity.

In declaring that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, the ANC and
its allies recognised that the anti-thesis to racial subjugation was the
liberation of all South Africans; that the system it fought against was
racial, but the solution to it was the unity of all irrespective of race,
colour or creed. It sought to liberate the oppressed as well as the
oppressor.

These politics guided the ANC's struggle over the years; and when it took
up arms, they guided its definition of the enemy as the system and those
who propped it up rather than a specific race group.

In its strategy and tactics, the ANC put politics at the fore, and it
defined itself and its army, Umkhonto weSizwe, as an instrument of a
people in political motion; the barrel of the gun as one of the means -
and not the means, least of all, an end in itself. It mobilised the
people to revolt in an organised fashion; it mobilised the international
community to act decisively against apartheid.

These billions united in the struggle against apartheid, each
contributing in their own way to the demise of this iniquitous system.

The legitimacy and legality of this struggle were written in numerous
covenants of the international community. They were written on the ballot
papers in April 1994.

The legitimacy and legality of the revolt of the oppressed are written in
the constitution which defines the kind of society that the ANC and the
overwhelming majority of South Africans fought for, and to which they pay
allegiance. Above all, they are written in the hearts of millions of
South Africans who were in essence their own liberators; and who today
are taking active part in the reconstruction and development of the
country.

In its conduct of armed struggle, the ANC sought to avoid civilian injury
and loss of life. It ensured that its combatants understood the reasons
behind the armed struggle as well as the tactics required to win to our
side the overwhelming majority of South Africans. In its treatment of
captured agents and combatants of the apartheid regime, it emphasised the
need for their rehabilitation. It committed itself to international norms
in this regard.

And, even at the height of massive repression, the ANC initiated
negotiations with the apartheid regime; and it persisted over many years
despite being arrogantly spurned, with these efforts culminating in the
transition at the turn of this decade.

Yet, as indicated in the main submission and further elaborated in this
document, mistakes were made, which we sincerely regret.

We are also mindful that armed conflict meant that combatants on both
sides confronted one another in various terrains and under various
circumstances. That is in the nature of war; and for such legitimate acts
of war, we expect a balanced appreciation of the circumstances that
obtained at the time.

Yet this appreciation cannot detract from the need to handle with
compassion the victims of the conflict in general, whatever the
circumstances which spawned their privations.

In the final analysis, through the new democratic order, we seek to make
conflict and war unnecessary.

In our new constitution and its recognition of individual rights and
rights of communities; in socio-economic development; in open and
transparent government; in new doctrines and through supervision of the
security services; in the judiciary and other institutions charged with
enhancing democracy; in the media whose independence is guaranteed; and,
above all, in an informed, active and organised citizenry, we have the
wherewithal to build a society in which violent conflict and the excesses
that go with it are forever eliminated.

This is what inspired the members, combatants and supporters of the ANC.
This is what inspires us today as we strive to build a better life for
all South Africans.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS 

In our first submission we concentrated on providing the TRC with an
overview of ANC policies, strategy and tactics within the context of the
struggle for national liberation in this country. We paid particular
attention to those issues which are central to the mandate of the TRC:
the nature, causes and extent of gross violations of human rights, as
defined in the Act which brought the TRC into being.

The questions we have received from the TRC in response to our first
submission indicate that at present your primary areas of concern include
establishing a clearer understanding of ANC policies; of the ANC's
structures and lines of accountability; and of who was responsible for
ensuring that ANC policy was adhered to by the general membership of the
ANC. Several questions indicate the related concern of the TRC to
establish a better understanding of what actions were taken by the
leadership of the ANC to deal with instances where there were deviations
from policy. Concern has been indicated regarding the need for better
understanding of the ANC's policies with regard to Inkatha, particularly
in the context of the violence in Kwa-Zulu Natal since 1984, and the
post-1990 explosion of violence in Gauteng.

In addition to several questions reflecting these key areas of concern,
the TRC has asked for detailed information on the activities of Umkhonto
we Sizwe and the ANC's former Department of National Intelligence and
Security (NAT). More information on the activities of the former
apartheid regime has been requested, particularly with regard to the
National Co-ordinating Mechanism and other covert activities.

Our response to these major areas of concern is presented as follows:
* a submission concentrating on questions concerning ANC policies,
  structures of accountability within the ANC, other relevant
  institutions and procedures, and actions taken by the leadership to
  halt deviations from policy. Our responses to questions from the TRC
  relating to the activities of the former apartheid regime are also
  included in this document.
* two operational reports which aim to provide the TRC with a clearer
  understanding of the mandates and activities of MK and NAT.
We wish to emphasise that this is a supplement to, and not a substitute
for, the main submission presented to the Commission in August 1996. As
such, there are many areas regarding ANC policy, our general approach to
struggle, the context in which our actions took place, the policies and
actions of the apartheid regime, which are not covered in this
operational report. The two submissions should be treated as
complementary.

In instances where there is insufficient detail, this is either because
the information is not available, or because the relevant issues will be
covered appropriately and adequately in individual applications for
amnesty.

1. ANC STRUCTURES 

The TRC has asked for information on the functions and composition of a
range of structures, political and military, at national and regional
levels. This information, with diagrams, is attached to this submission
as Appendix 1.

A full list of all MK camps, a list of rehabilitation centres, and the
names of the commanders, is provided in Appendix 2.

The TRC has asked how these various sectors interacted, and which formal
and informal channels of communication were in place. These questions, we
believe, will be answered in the context of the detailed operational
reports.

2. ANC POLICIES 

2.1 ANC POLICY REGARDING "JUSTIFIED TARGETS" 

The TRC has requested "further clarification of the ANC's definition of a
"justified target". We have been asked whether there were any recorded
instructions defining justified targets besides the pamphlet circulated
in 1985 in which the ANC called on the people to "take the struggle to
the white areas", and in which targets were inter alia defined as "the
racist army, police, death squads, agents and stooges in our midst." The
TRC wants to know whether this definition of targets could be "used to
legitimize the killing of policemen, alleged informers, community
councillors, and co-opted parliamentarians", and what we mean by the term
"stooges in our midst." Elsewhere we were asked "to what extent should
ANC leadership take responsibility for acts of violence committed by UDF
supporters, (eg. necklacings, petrol bomb attacks)?" The TRC has asked
for more information on Bartholomew Hlapane, and whether the ANC takes
responsibility for his execution. The TRC has asked what was the ANC's
"military policy" towards Inkatha, and whether the ANC leadership
considered members of Inkatha "legitimate military targets." 

Defining targets, 1961 - the early 1980s 

In our main submission, we referred to this subject on a number of
occasions. The draft document Operation Mayibuye (see p 48) defined
targets as "strategic road, railways and other communications; power
stations; police stations, camps, and military forces; and irredeemable
government stooges."

In 1978, after the Politico-Military Strategy Commission, a report was
produced in which it was stated that the role of armed activity at that
time was to "concentrate on armed propaganda actions whose immediate
purpose is to support and stimulate political activity and organisation,
rather than to hit at the enemy."

In November 1980 the ANC declared its adherence to the Geneva Conventions.

In his statement at this time, OR Tambo said "We have always defined the
enemy in terms of a system of domination and not of a people or a
race...As we have done in the past, so shall we continue, consistently
and unreservedly, to support, fight for and abide by the principles of
international law."

In 1983, the document Planning for People's War noted that there should
be "more concentration on destroying enemy personnel", universally
understood within the ANC to mean members of the SAP, SADF, other
security structures, and their collaborators.

In the light of these quotations illustrating the ANC's definition of
justified targets, it is clear that action against the machinery of
repression - SAP and SADF members and informers - was considered
legitimate. These people had chosen to act in the front-line of
repression in defence of the apartheid regime.

In most cases those who were attacked by MK were notorious members of the
Security Branch, or those involving themselves in a particularly direct
manner in acts of violence against communities. There were also many
petrol-bomb attacks on the homes of members of the SAP which were carried
out by local activists. A survey of ANC statements will show that we
consistently called on members of the SAP and SADF to turn their arms on
the oppressor, and come over to the side of the liberation struggle.

Informers were essential tools of the security forces; without them, the
apartheid regime would have been seriously hampered in their attempts to
crush resistance. Many informers and "turned" cadres were directly
responsible for the imprisonment, detention and deaths of literally
thousands of activists and ANC leaders. An example of a particularly
dangerous informer is provided by Bartholomew Hlapane, about whom the TRC
requested more details. Hlapane was the most senior office-bearer to
betray the struggle - he had been a member of the ANC's NEC and of the
Central Committee of the SACP. Hlapane gave evidence in the trials of
Braam Fischer, and compounded this treachery by giving evidence for the
state in a number of other trials.

Hlapane crowned these deeds by playing a central role in the March 1982
Denton committee hearings in the USA, which produced "witnesses" supplied
by the apartheid regime. This propaganda exercise sought to seriously
damage the reputation of the ANC in the international arena, and to set
back the liberation struggle, by portraying the Movement as a terrorist
group under the control of the Soviet Union, carrying out depraved acts
such as infecting South Africa's water supplies with cholera. He was shot
by an MK unit.

Defining targets in the context of People's War 

There have been recent attempts to portray the 1983 constitutional
changes - against which the UDF mobilised millions of South Africans - as
evidence of progress towards a more equitable society, a process in which
the ANC should have participated, rather than intensifying the armed
struggle.

We feel it necessary to review this period briefly in order to ensure
that our understanding of the context in which the general uprisings of
1984 onwards took place, and in which the ANC called for the
intensification of the struggle on all fronts, is conveyed to the
Commission.

In the late 1970's the NP had begun to realise that it needed to extend
the base for military conscription; the SADF was in favour of extending
the call-up to "coloured" and Indian communities. However, it was
generally recognised that it would be difficult to conscript people who
did not have the vote.

A perceptive editorial published in the Rand Daily Mail commented on the
issue as follows: "The growing challenge to the South African state must
inevitably push matters to the point where further military mobilisation
will seriously damage the economy with its endemic shortage of skilled
labour. Yet manpower constraint is not the only factor. (...) Equally
important is the public relations aspect. For propaganda purposes the
state clearly needs growing numbers of non-whites in the Defence Force to
project the view that the military build-up is not part of a racial and
class struggle, but rather a case of all South Africans preparing to
fight shoulder to shoulder against the forces of "communism and chaos." A
third reason for Coloured and Indian conscription concerns the National
Party constituency. All along, the Nationalist leadership has made it
clear to its followers that the extended rights and privileges the
Coloureds and Indians will receive in the new dispensation will carry
with them increased responsibilities of "full citizenship". That means,
quite simply, also sharing the burden of defence."1  The majority of
South Africans - those not classified "white", "coloured" or "Indian" -
were explicitly barred from the new racist "tricameral" parliamentary
system, which unashamedly sought to further entrench apartheid by drawing
allies into the laager to assist in preventing democratic change.

These moves were combined with the three Koornhof Bills, which also aimed
to further entrench - not dismantle - existing apartheid institutions:
two aimed to bolster the community councils, while the Orderly Movement
and Settlement of Black Persons Bill, which became known as the "Genocide
Bill", proposed the tightening of influx control so that those in the
impoverished bantustans would be permanently frozen out of the urban
areas. The regime made it clear that it wanted these councils to form the
basis for whatever "Bantu" political expression it would tolerate outside
the "homelands"; in essence, the councils were to be the urban
equivalents of the bantustans!

The ANC called on people to mobilize against and destroy the structures
created in terms of these laws, as did many community-based organisations
within the country which rallied under the banner of the United
Democratic Front. There were mass boycotts of elections to these puppet
structures. Many councillors were elected on pathetically low polls, and
there was intense pressure from communities on councillors and MPs to
resign from these structures. In many cases councillors resigned and were
welcomed back into their communities.

The quote we used from the ANC's January 1984 annual statement (p 51 of
our first submission) was chosen because it provides a clear example of
the ANC's understanding that military struggle could not occur in a
political vacuum, and was one of a number of inter- related forms of
struggle against apartheid. "The system" in all its manifestations was
the target of mass-based struggle.

These institutions of apartheid are identified as the "organs of central
and provincial government, the army and the police, the judiciary, the
bantustan administrations, the community councils, the local management
and local affairs committees." The statement continues: "It is these
institutions of apartheid that we must attack and demolish...Thus,
through our efforts, the so-called Coloured Persons Representative
Council ceased to exist; as a result of extensive mobilisation, the
puppet South African Indian Council was brought in by an insignificant
minority. (...) White South Africa alone should man the apartheid
constitutional posts, which it alone has created, to its exclusive
benefit. Those who elect to serve in these apartheid institutions must
expect to face the wrath of the people."

The TRC has asked us to define what we meant by "stooges in our midst".
These could be described as those among the oppressed who chose to
directly assist in apartheid oppression and repression. Councillors and
those who chose to serve in the tricameral parliament and participate in
repression, certainly fell into this group of collaborators with
apartheid.

A critical point which must be made is that a guarantee for conflict at
local level was built into this new legislation: the new community
councils had to be self-financing.

As a study by Haysom noted, resistance to these structures at grassroots
level intensified "as community councils imposed the predicted rent rises
on impoverished townships in a futile bid to balance the books of their
"autonomous" local authorities, as they employed their own police to act
against squatters, as they evicted people from their homes, as they
participated in talks on removals. "It was in this context, rather than
in straightforward political campaigning, that physical attacks on
councillors and on their property were launched by angry crowds of
residents. Attacks on policemen's homes became commonplace at a much
later stage of the...resistance, after fatal clashes between police and
residents had become commonplace and mass arrests and detentions had
become the order of the day. Political reservations about community
councils and the councillors would not have touched ordinary residents
had not the worsening economic situation in South Africa forced residents
into direct conflict with the community councils...Allegations of
corruption levelled at community councillors have been numerous and
widespread. 2 
"It is thus not surprising that in September 1984, civil unrest commenced
with a protest march against the rent increases imposed by the community
council at Sebokeng. As a result, several people, including two community
councillors, were killed on that fateful third (day of) September. Unrest
spread from the PWV-Free State area to the Eastern Cape and the Western
Cape. In nearly all these areas, the increasing role of community
councillors (and police) in administering these deprived areas, and the
material benefits they enjoyed as a consequence, were identified as one
of the problems and pressure of various kinds was placed on them to
resign."3  This passage from an eyewitness account of the Sebokeng
uprising of September 1984 gives insight into the attitudes of many
township residents towards the councillors: "(The Apostle) Paul has said
that not all of us should be leaders, as leaders are more punished than
anybody else. So, referring that to our situation, no man should just
agree to be a leader if he has no true qualities of leadership, and
no-one should feel easy on the throne he has been nominated to occupy, if
he has not been freely elected by the public. This I say because, if you
keep on ruling defiant hearts, the time they revolt against you not one
piece of your belongings together with your life will remain yours. If
people are dissatisfied with you, it is better for you to resign before
the terrible dark clouds overwhelm you in your wilderness; if you defy
their needs, then you ask for a brutal retribution.
"This I say to the remaining councillors: that they should never regard
their own opinions as more weighty than those of the people they rule;
and that the well-being of the community should not be ignored, or the
response will be more horrible than the conflagration that destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah."4  A survey of available information shows that the
overwhelming majority of attacks on the homes of town councillors (or
members of the tricameral legislature) were carried out by local
activists, and were often in the context of explosive anger on the ground
in response to initiatives by councils or brutalities by the security
forces. The number of deaths and injuries which resulted from these
attacks were extremely limited when compared with the deaths and injuries
inflicted on members of anti-apartheid organisations. Whilst the ANC (and
UDF) leadership did not order such attacks, and took no pleasure in any
loss of life resulting from such actions, it certainly did not condemn
them in principle. Although the ANC leadership did not at all times
approve of the methods adopted by people, actions of this nature were in
essence the result of state repression, and they were in line with the
ANC's stated policy to mobilise people against institutions designed to
yet further entrench apartheid.

A brief review of statistics published by the SAIRR in its annual surveys
covering the years 1983 - 1986 will serve to illustrate these points.

In 1983, there was one attack at a community council office in New
Brighton, which resulted in one death and five injuries. In 1984, of the
175 people killed in "unrest related incidents" during the year, four
were councillors who were "killed by enraged crowds." 149 of these 175
deaths in 1984 took place after the 3rd of September - the day which
signalled the beginning of serious civil unrest, when residents of
Sebokeng marched against a rent increase imposed by the council.

By April 1985, according to the Department of Constitutional Development,
twelve councillors had died since the beginning of September 1984. The
SAIRR annual survey for 1985 lists several petrol-bomb attacks on
councillor's homes across the country, and a few incidents in which
grenades were used. There were (according to the SAIRR survey) four cases
of attacks on the homes of tricameral MPs; no injuries or deaths are
mentioned. All of these attacks were petrol bomb attacks, with hand
grenades used as well in two cases.

The SAIRR's statistics for 1985 show that twenty-six members of the
security forces were killed by residents of townships, while one was
killed by "guerrillas." In the same period, 441 township residents had
been killed by members of the security forces. These statistics do not
include a breakdown of the large numbers of deaths and serious injuries
caused by state- sponsored "vigilante" groups which intensified suddenly
in the latter half of 1985. MK units were encouraged to support
communities in ridding the country of these violent collaborators with
apartheid.

According to the SAIRR's 1986 annual survey, it was difficult to compile
accurate statistics for this year because of heavy censorship of the
media by the apartheid regime. Adriaan Vlok claimed that 18 members of
the SAP were killed and 192 injured in "rioting" during the year. This
included attacks on "special constables" who had been introduced to stamp
out popular organisations and prop up the councils. There are no
statistics for the number of attacks on councillors during this year;
there were "spates" of attacks on councillors and others perceived as
collaborators in February in Alexandra, in May in Thokoza, and in
September in Soweto. Besides these incidents, the SAIRR survey lists
seven attacks on councillors in which one councilor was hacked to death
and the child of a councilor was similarly killed "by a group of five
men". Nearly all the attacks listed are described as being carried out by
"mobs" or as petrol bomb attacks. In a few cases hand grenades were used
and in one case a limpet mine exploded at a block of flats in Fordsburg,
which was used to house Soweto councillors.

This survey lists one (1) petrol bomb attack on the home of a Labour
Party MP. In contrast, according to the SAIRR, at least 1,298 deaths in
"political violence" took place during the year, with activists, trade
unionists and religious leaders the targets of petrol bomb, hand grenade
and hit squad attacks.

According to the SAIRR Annual Survey for 1988 (p. 602), "speaking in
Parliament In March 1988, Chris Heunis declined to say how many community
councillors and members of black local authorities had died as a result
of their holding these offices. Mr Heunis said that although these people
had been "attacked and killed or injured in 1986 and 1987, it cannot
beyond doubt be attributed to their holding these offices."

It would be most accurate to say that the ANC did not define councillors
as targets - they themselves chose whether or not to define themselves as
particular enemies of their communities, and it was usually members of
their own communities who acted against them. There is also the
possibility that some attacks on targets of this nature were "false flag"
operations. In 1988, the home of Allan Hendrickse, leader of the Labour
Party, was the target of a hand grenade attack. In 1992, the SAP took
legal action against the Afrikaans weekly Vrye Weekblad to prevent it
publishing allegations that police were directly involved in this attack.
Hernus Kriel then twice avoided answering questions put to him in
Parliament by Michael and Peter Hendrickse, as to whether the state had
been responsible for this attack. It appears this case remains unsolved.

The ANC's definition of justified targets - and conflict in general in
the 1980s - should also be understood in the context of the parameters
defined by the regime's counter-mobilisation tactics and the harnessing
of the National Security Management System (NSMS) to crush resistance.

The growth of popular and effective grassroots organisations, which
successfully resisted evictions and rent increases, and took up other
bread-and-butter issues in their communities, threatened and marginalised
the community councils. It was critically important to the state to
support the community council system, at all costs: a revealing statement
in this regard was made by Magnus Malan in late 1987. Speaking in
Parliament, he identified what he called six factors which affect
security: law and order; structures in the black community; housing;
employment opportunities; education; and strike activity. By "structures
in black communities", he said, he meant tertiary levels of government,
that is, the town councils. "If things go wrong on this level, the top
cracks", he said. This provides some insight into the reasons behind the
degree of ferocity with which the apartheid regime sought to prop up
these utterly discredited structures.

The National Joint Management Centre of the NSMS co-ordinated a network
of Joint Management Committees at local, sub-regional and regional
levels; each JMC had various sub-committees, including an intelligence
sub-committee. At local level, these commi ttees brought together the
security forces, pro-government black figures and township administrators
with the aim of securing political and security control in their areas.
Many councillors were therefore directly collaborating in the violence of
the apartheid state.

Attempts by the state to "counter-mobilise" against popular organisations
to prop up the community council and bantustan systems resulted in the
emergence of the "vigilantes", particularly in the latter half of 1985.
Along with municipal police, the regime used "vigilantes" in an attempt
to destroy popular, legal organisations in the townships; they were also
deployed to crush resistance to the "independence" of KwaNdebele. In
KwaZulu, the same period saw the emergence of a related phenomenon - the
"warlords." Ebenezer Maqina's counter-mobilisation group, the AmaAfrika
National Front (code-named "Project Henry" by the government's covert
operation, Adult Education Consultants, which was responsible for
handling him) provides a key example of the degree to which the state was
involved in fuelling violence at grassroots level during this period.

Maqina served on the local Joint Management Centre in Port Elizabeth, and
was in the forefront of violence against grassroots organisations in the
area, generally portrayed as "UDF/Azapo conflict." SAP agents such as
Patrick Dlongwana were deployed to assist. Another example is provided by
the DMI-run programme of support for the mayor of Zwide, Thamsanqa Linda,
which was code-named "Project Tommy" - also falling under the control of
the local AdEd structure. It is more than probable that all "vigilante"
leaders and councillors were directly linked to these covert intelligence
and security structures.

This violence was cynically and deliberately portrayed as
"black-on-black" violence, and is now dishonestly presented as the result
of the ANC's refusal to participate in the regime's legislative programme
to further bolster apartheid.

Just a few other examples of these "vigilante" groups include the
"Phakathis" or "A Team" of Thabong, in which it was alleged several
councillors were involved and which used council property; vigilantes in
places such as Leandra and Huhudi were responsible for hacking to death
and shooting many activists and popular leaders. There were many others,
such as the Memesis and Kekanas in the Eastern Cape, also grouped around
unpopular councillors, which the regime hoped could become part of their
covertly-run "Xhosa Resistance Movement" along with their "AmaAfrika
National Front. "

The death of Councillor Kinikini in Uitenhage provides an example of the
circumstances under which a number of councillors were killed, and of how
the state itself was directly involved in fuelling violence at grassroots
level through its attempts to counter-mobilise communities and prop up
the administrative pillars of apartheid. All the councillors in
Kwanobuhle resigned, except for Benjamin Kinikini. He was hated in his
community because he, together with a man named Jimmy Claasen, had
surrounded himself with an armed "vigilante" group calling itself "the
Peacemakers."

This gang was mentioned in a number of trials at the time; they
"arrested" people, "tried" them, assaulted them, and handed them over to
the police. They often held people prisoner in Kinikini's funeral
parlour. In one case a sixteen-year-old girl was abducted, raped, and
forced to lie in a coffin all night by this gang of thugs. Counsel for
defence in one public violence trial stated that it was well-known the
"Peacemakers" were in the pay of the SAP. On Sharpeville Day, March 21st
1985, the Uitenhage massacre took place when police shot dead seventeen
civilians. Anger was running very high in Kwanobuhle and other townships.
On the morning of March 23rd, Jimmy Claasen and at least one Kinikini
kidnapped four youths at gunpoint from their homes, and held them captive
in the mortuary section of Kinikini's funeral parlour; they then took
them to the bush and sjambokked them. People gathered at Kinikini's
business to demand the release of the youths, attacked the building, and
eventually an enraged crowd hacked Kinikini and five male relatives to
death.

An article published in Sechaba (April 1987) on the Sharpeville Six, who
had been convicted on the doctrine of common purpose for the killing of a
councillor, expressed the ANC's attitude in this way: "The ANC stands
absolutely with the Six, and with all others facing the same fate, and
does not discriminate between those who identify themselves consciously
with the ANC and those who do not. Because it has won the support of the
masses and thus has the responsibility for providing a disciplined
structure and leadership for that struggle, the ANC has the duty to
defend unhesitatingly those who ally themselves with its objectives.
(...) Further, the evidence in the trial showed beyond all doubt that the
councillor identified himself with the regime, and was willing to enforce
its oppressive laws. In fact, the judges of this regime made this very
point, and attached importance to it."

The phenomenon of  "necklacing" 

As the mass-based resistance against apartheid took root in the
mid-eighties, the ANC leadership strongly disapproved of some of the
methods chosen by people to kill informers and other collaborators,
particularly the "necklace", and stated this on more than one occasion.
UDF leaders also condemned the use of the "necklace" on several
occasions. But the ANC leadership refused, and will always refuse to
condemn those who believed they were part of the struggle for liberation
led by the ANC and the UDF, and were making their contribution by ridding
communities of informers and those amongst them who directly collaborated
in apartheid violence (please refer to our first submission, pp 77 - 78).

The extent to which the NP has consistently tried to use the phenomenon
of "necklacing" to damage the ANC and divert attention from their own
atrocities has always raised the suspicion that they were involved in
some of these incidents. It was certainly their agent, Joe Mamasela, who
was centrally involved in creating the conditions under which the first
recorded "necklacing" took place, which was conveniently filmed in
horrific detail, immediately sent out world-wide, and portrayed as
"evidence" of the savagery of the ANC. A number of covertly-funded fronts
were prominent in propaganda campaigns focused on "necklacing." There has
also recently been a profoundly dishonest attempt to create the
impression that Chris Hani expressed approval of, and claimed ANC
responsibility for, the phenomenon of "necklacing" by quoting one
sentence from a lengthy response he made to a question on the ANC's
attitude towards "necklacing". Here is the reply he gave in 1986: "You
know for a long time South Africa, being a colonialist power of a special
type, has depended on the continued repression of our people through
active collaboration by puppets. We know that even in the classic
colonial situation in countries like India, Kenya, the old Tanganyika and
elsewhere, the colonialist has always depended on the African askari.
Similarly, in our country, we know ourselves that the colonialist, the
racist regime if you like, has always depended on the active
collaboration of the oppressed on the recruitment of the Black policeman,
the Black special branch. Because the Black policeman the Black special
branch and the Black agent stay in the same township as we do, they have
been the conduit through which information about our activities, about
our plans has been passed to the enemy. This has made the process of
organisation and mobilisation very difficult.

"So the necklace was a weapon devised by the oppressed themselves to
remove this cancer from our society, the cancer of collaboration of the
puppets. It is not a weapon of the ANC. It is a weapon of the masses
themselves to cleanse the townships from the very disruptive and even
lethal activities of the puppets and collaborators. We do understand our
people when they use the necklace because it is an attempt to render our
townships, to render our areas and country ungovernable, to make the
enemy's access to information very difficult. But we are saying here our
people must be careful, in the sense that the enemy would employ
provocateurs to use the necklace, even against activists. We have our own
revolutionary methods of dealing with collaborators, the methods of the
ANC. But I refuse to condemn our people when they mete out their own
traditional forms of justice to those who collaborate. I understand their
anger. Why should they be cool as icebergs, when they are being killed
every day?

"As far as I am concerned, the question of the necklace and how it should
be used belongs to all of us, to the ANC, to the democratic movement. We
should sit down and discuss amongst ourselves how we should mete out
justice. What is revolutionary justice? One fact is that, where agents
and collaborators are concerned, we should establish, where it is
possible, our own revolutionary courts where justice should be meted out.
And in those courts we should involve some of our best cadres so that our
forms of justice do not degenerate into kangaroo justice. We would like
to maintain revolutionary forms of justice. But South Africa is not a
normal society; the situation is very very abnormal. People are angry
because we are fighting fascism in that country.

"The ANC will never abandon its leading role. We are saying to our
people, whatever method you devise, there should be democratic
participation, there should be democratic discussion, and whatever method
we use, that method should conform to the norms of the revolutionary
movement. As I say we understand why the necklace has been used. We know
even the negative and positive aspects of the necklace. There is a lot of
discussion now going on the question of the necklace. But it is not this
silly co nclusion that it is Black on Black violence. The necklace has
been used against those who have been actively collaborating with the
enemy. We say the movement should be vigilant to ensure that whatever
sentence is passed on anybody, it is a result o f participation by the
revolutionary elements of our struggle." (Sechaba, December 1986.) In
October 1987, the Botha regime refused to grant The Sunday Tribune
permission to quote OR Tambo after he had made a speech in which he
stated that the ANC was strongly opposed to the practice of "necklacing."
Helen Suzman commented that this was a "shameless use of selective
prohibition. (...) A statement where "necklacing", one of the most
outrageous acts attributed to the ANC, is strongly discouraged, yet the
government does not allow this to be published."

In yet another example of dishonest attempts to exploit the issue of
"necklacing", untrue statements by bank robber Lucky Malaza, who somehow
was "mistakenly" released by the De Klerk administration as a political
prisoner after falsely claiming to have been involved in a necklace
murder, have been quoted at some length in the NP's latest submission to
the TRC.

We trust that as the work of the Commission continues, the truth in
regard to the lengths to which the stratkom structures of the apartheid
regime went to use "necklacing" to discredit the ANC and the UDF, and to
promote the perception that covert st ate-sponsored terrorism was
"black-on-black" violence, will be brought to light.

Targets in the context of violence in KwaZulu in the 1980s 

The TRC has asked what was the ANC's "military policy" towards Inkatha,
and whether the ANC leadership considered members of Inkatha to be
"legitimate military targets." The ANC had no "military policy" with
regard to Inkatha. The ANC has never considered Inkatha members or
officials as targets simply because they aligned themselves with Inkatha.

The predominant feature of the violence in KwaZulu-Natal in the 1980s was
attacks on whole communities. "Warlords" played a pivotal role in this
violence, assisted by elements within the SAP who either refused to
intervene or actively supported the aggressors. Those communities (or
sections of communities) who did not actively support Inkatha were
regarded automatically as being ANC- or UDF-aligned, and became the
target for violence. In essence this was the same pattern of violence
experienced by urban communities in other parts of the country at this
time, when the "vigilantes" were armed and deployed in defence of the
administrative pillars of the apartheid state.

These activities were not unique to KwaZulu Natal, Inkatha or any other
organisation in the overall context of the struggle to end apartheid, and
the activities of the former apartheid regime to counter this threat
through a range of illegal covert methods based on the theory of
counter-mobilisation.

In Natal, and in KwaZulu in particular, the violence against
anti-apartheid organisations and individuals intensified in the mid-1980s
with the emergence of the "warlords" and "vigilantes" in rural and urban
areas. These included gangs such as the AmaSinyora in KwaMashu, the core
of which consisted of criminals who had been recruited in prison. Others
were the Amakwebi in Chesterville, and the A-Team in townships such as
Chesterville and Lamontville. In addition, the NP covertly set up UWUSA
(one of several projects running under the umbrella of Project Ancor),
which operated in the labour field and concentrated on violent
strike-breaking and the destabilisation of COSATU-affiliated unions; in
several incidents people were killed. The Caprivi trainees were organised
into hit squads and deployed in 1986-1987.

All these sources of violence against the enemies of the apartheid state
were deliberately created by the NP government, in line with the
counter-mobilisation tactics they had adopted to crush resistance. They
were trained, armed, managed and covertly funded via the NP's security
and intelligence agencies, particularly the Department of Military
Intelligence, the Security Branch, and the Kwa-Zulu Police. Some of this
training was done under the cover of "white right wing support" for
Inkatha.

According to a top secret report to the State Security Council prepared
by a "work group" consisting of "Kat" Liebenberg, Joep Joubert (in
command of the Special Forces at the time) and "Tienie" Groenewald (a
stratkom specialist in DMI), the central objectives of Operation Marion
were (to quote from the report) "to limit ANC/UDF intimidation amongst
the black population by means of Inkatha", and to "establish Inkatha as a
more effective organisation against the ANC/UDF" - in other words, to use
Inkatha to "counter-mobilise" against the mass democratic movement, in
the same way that other groups were covertly set up or manipulated, as
described above.

Given the active involvement of the NP government (via its security
forces) in this conflict, communities were left defenceless; it was up to
them to try to defend themselves. A key example is provided by the
formation of SDUs in Edendale in 1987 in response to wholesale and
arbitrary attacks on the community. In some cases particular Inkatha
officials or members distinguished themselves through violence against
leaders or communities whom they perceived as a political threat, and
themselves became targets for attacks, carried out by members of local
communities. Many "warlords", if not all, were directly supported or
controlled by handlers in the NP's intelligence and security
establishment. Possibly at times MK cadres based in these areas
participated in counter- or pre-emptive attacks. Such attacks were almost
invariably motivated by the need for self-defence, or to protect
communities under threat.

Allegations to the effect that MK has been engaged in "serial mass
murder" of hundreds Inkatha officials are part of a long-running stratkom
operation with the objectives of creating confusion with regard to the
true perpetrators of violence in KwaZulu Natal, whipping up maximum
levels of enmity and fear at grassroots level, and ensuring that
reconciliation is as difficult as possible.

The accuracy of this so-called "death list" has been called into doubt on
more than one occasion by violence monitors and investigative
journalists, who point out that the compilers of this list have tended to
claim that anyone killed in certain areas was an "Inkatha leader", and in
some cases those on the list were not members of Inkatha at all.

Attempts by the UDF and other organisations to halt this violence over
the years must be mentioned. These attempts have been consistently
derailed or spurned by elements within the leadership of Inkatha,
presumably on the advice of their handlers. Whilst the late Harry Gwala
was in prison, and also immediately after his release, he advocated peace
and negotiations with Inkatha. On his release, Chief Buthelezi wrote him
a letter congratulating him, which was cordially responded to by Harry
Gwala. However, as the violence in the Natal Midlands took off - which
was characterised by indiscriminate killings of even elderly people and
children - Harry Gwala increasingly urged communities to defend
themselves. As he put it, were communities to fold their arms and
passively accept attacks? He encouraged people to form SDUs and resist
attacks, rather than run away and be forced to live as refugees.

Operation Marion was not terminated when De Klerk took over. The SAP
report written in March 1990, and which came to light at the time of the
"Inkathagate" scandal in 1991, made it clear that a key objective of the
continued covert support afforded to Inkatha at this time was to prevent
the Inkatha leadership "throwing in (their) lot with the ANC" as the
negotiations phase began. This is the context in which conflict in
KwaZulu Natal since the 1980s, and the violence in the post-1990 phase,
should be seen.

Information regarding the role of police agent Sifiso Nkabinde in
ensuring that violence continued in the Midlands has very recently come
to light, and will no doubt yet again underline the pivotal role of the
NP in this conflict and bloodshed - the "ANC/Inkatha conflict" in this
region was largely yet another version of "black-on-black" violence (ie.
the results of counter-mobilisation) elsewhere in the country as
described in our earlier submission.

2.2 ARMED OPERATIONS AND CIVILIAN CASUALTIES 

The TRC has asked for detailed information on "the scope and scale of
legitimate MK operations" as well as attacks not in accordance with ANC
policy which had "become a trend in the late 1980s." In a separate
question the TRC asked "to what extent do MK commanders in the Front Line
States take responsibility for actions - especially those involving
civilian targets - of cadres inside the country?" 

The TRC has asked us to assess to what extent "militant rhetoric and
ambiguous statements" led to possible cases of misinterpretation of "ANC
policy on soft tagets." 

In a separate section on the Ellis Park bomb of 1988, the TRC has quoted
Chris Hani and Steve Tshwete at some length, commenting on this blast.
The TRC says their comments appeared to imply that "any inner-city
location could represent a legitimate target because of the possibility
that the police or army may have located an office in an ostensibly
innocuous-looking building. Did such statements not confuse the
definition of a legitimate target?" They underline this point by asking
whether the leadership condoned "such actions of killing and injuring
civilians", and whether there were "different perceptions on the
definition of legitimate targets among ANC leaders." 

The TRC has asked what steps were taken by the ANC to avoid civilian
casualties in landmine explosions, and how many civilians were killed in
these incidents. 

The scope and scale of MK operations 

Whilst regional ANC structures (RPMCs) had a greater level of autonomy in
the post 1983 period, and did not have to clear all operations with
Lusaka before going ahead, all ANC members and officials were bound by
ANC policy with regard to the armed struggle, and did not develop their
own policies.

We feel it is very important to point out that attacks not in accordance
with ANC policy did not become a trend in the late 1980s, in the sense
that such actions became the dominant form of all MK attacks. This is
shown clearly in the lists of armed actions during the period in
question. Attacks resulting in primarily civilian casualties represented
a very small proportion of all armed actions: the majority of MK actions
continued to be in line with ANC policy during this period, which is
testimony to the degree of discipline amongst our cadres in the face of
extreme provocation.

The attached MK Operations report includes two lists of armed operations.
The first of these consists of a list of armed operations, arranged
chronologically and according to nature of target, which we believe were
carried out by legitimate MK units.

The second list consists of incidents of armed action which fall into a
grey area with regard to the nature of the intended target, and also
includes incidents for which we suspect MK cadres were not responsible.

With regard to these lists of incidents of armed action, it is important
to note that the ANC did not keep records of all operations carried out
by our cadres - this in any event would have been a suicidal breach of
elementary security procedures - and as we have tried to show, given the
nature of guerrilla warfare, cadres had to make decisions for themselves
at times; they did not constantly report to their commanders. We must
emphasise that we cannot be certain that these lists are entirely accur
ate or comprehensive. The information was drawn largely from press
reports and similar sources, and given the degree of censorship practiced
by the government at the time, it is possible that many incidents were
deliberately prevented from reaching the press. Where questions arise on
specific incidents, the ANC will make every effort to assist the TRC.

Armed actions and civilian casualties 

The ANC, of which MK was an integral part and entirely subordinate to the
political leadership, did not approve of attacks on "civilian targets".
Attacks on civilian targets would be morally indefensible, and
strategically senseless: they would not only be in contradiction to the
ANC's work to avert racial civil war, but would alienate domestic and
international support for the struggle against apartheid.

As indicated in our first submission, a number of attacks did take place,
carried out by MK, which were not in line with ANC policy. What were the
reasons behind this, and what was the attitude of the ANC towards these
incidents?

Some attacks occurred because of anger. The period between late 1984 and
1988 witnessed unprecedented violence directed at black civilians. This
behaviour of the regime was a significant factor in provoking certain
attacks which were in breach of policy. Anger on the ground was
explosive: the atrocities committed by the apartheid regime demanded
retaliation. In some cases, cadres responded to state brutality by
hitting back in anger, as soon as possible - as in the case of the
Amanzimtoti bomb, described in detail in our main submission.

The attitude of the apartheid regime, which refused to take prisoners of
war, was another factor. When unexpected difficulties arose, cadres had
to decide on their feet: and sometimes they made wrong decisions. At
times, the situations they faced were desperate to the extent that it is
highly unlikely that there would be a peaceful outcome, even if they had
surrendered - the Silverton bank siege and the Goch Street incident are
cases in point.

Gathering tactical intelligence was the responsibility of units on the
ground; this was exceptionally difficult given the conditions in the
country. At times attacks which appear to be aimed at civilian targets
were nothing of the sort - the cadre may have had information to the
effect that an SADF or SAP group would be present at a particular railway
station or hotel or restaurant at a particular time, but due to a range
of difficulties - ranging from faulty intelligence to devices which
malfunction and go off at the wrong time - an explosion occurs,
apparently senselessly, in a civilian area. The Magoos Bar attack falls
into this category, as indicated in our first submission to the TRC. It
is also possible that some of these incidents occurred through deliberate
disinformation, in which infiltrators into MK units set up attacks of
this nature.

Technical difficulties accounted for a number of these incidents. At
times insufficient training could have resulted in situations in which
cadres were not able to ensure that explosions took place at the intended
time, and made mistakes in setting timing devices. At times accidents
occurred. Defective timing mechanisms accounted for some of these
incidents, and resulted in unintended civilian casualties - the
Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court bomb is a case in point, and there were
probably others.

At times, an operation would take place in support of campaigns or other
struggles taking place within the community - such as strike action, mass
retrenchments, a rent or bus boycott. An explosion at an office block, a
railway line, factory or supermarket makes sense in this context.
Civilians were never the targets in these cases - they would in most
cases be our supporters or potential supporters; however, it did happen
in some instances that the timing of a blast went wrong for a range of
reasons and resulted in unintended civilian casualties.

We feel it is important to also bring to the attention of the Commission
certain relevant factors which flow from the essential character of a
guerrilla army.

In contrast with a conventional military force, in which virtually all
planning takes place at HQ level by experienced officers, in guerrilla
warfare most of the initiative is with the unit, and detailed planning
takes place at the lowest level. Each cadre has to be trusted to make
decisions with regard to choice of target within ANC policy, whilst
keeping a close eye on developments and feelings among the people in
his/her community - a responsibility which no soldier in a conventional
force ever has to face.

There were long and insecure lines of communication, command and control.
There was no "hotline" to higher structures to ask for guidance; the
vulnerability of clandestine communication could - and at times did -
result in the arrests and deaths of cadres. Consequently, a great deal
depended on the political maturity, general experience, and immediate
situation in which each cadre operated. Many of the established MK units
had been allowed a degree of initiative in executing their operations, as
long as these remained within policy guidelines; training in MK camps
took this reality into account. In fact it was in part to deal with these
problems that Operation Vula was launched, to establish senior political
and military leadership inside the country.

Maintaining discipline in guerrilla and conventional armed forces is also
fundamentally different. In the case of a guerrilla force, discipline
flows from a thorough understanding of the political objectives of the
armed struggle - not from threats of court-martial or punishment.

MK cadres conducted crash courses for eager volunteers inside the
country. Some of these recruits had sketchy political understanding of
the nature of the struggle in comparison with those cadres who had gone
through the intensive political and military training provided in camps
in exile. Some supporters had loose connections with MK units, and
drifted in and out of structures; they were never thoroughly under the
discipline of the ANC and MK, yet commanders on the ground sometimes
found their contributions indispensable.

We have described the conditions under which the Kabwe conference was
held in our first submission. The struggle had to be intensified; in the
period after the Kabwe Conference, less emphasis was placed on avoiding
civilian casualties at all costs in pursuit of attacks on legitimate
targets. As ANC President at the time, OR Tambo, put it: "I will
summarise the position taken by the Conference in these terms: that the
struggle must be intensified at all costs. Over the past nine to ten
months at least - at the very least - there have been many soft targets
hit by the enemy. Nearly five hundred people have now died in that
period...massacred, shot down killed secretly. All those were very, very
soft targets. They belong to the sphere of the intensification of the
struggle. What we have seen in places like the Eastern Cape is what
escalation means for everybody. The distinction between "hard" and "soft"
targets is going to disappear in an intensified conflict, in an
escalating conflict. (...)
"I am not saying that our Conference used the word "soft targets". I am
saying that Conference recognised that we are in it. It is happening
every day. It happened two days before we started our Conference - a
massacre in Gaborone. We did not complain that soft targets were being
hit, because they have been hitting them, as I say, all the time. What we
did was to re-commit ourselves to intensify the armed struggle (...)
until the system which makes massacres and conflicts necessary, is
abolished..." With regard to the quotes from Steve Tshwete and Chris Hani
on which the TRC has requested comment, it is clear to us that their
statements do not depart from stated ANC policy in the post-1985 era on
the issue of legitimate targets. In fact, they are in line with what the
President of the ANC emphasised after the Kabwe Conference: that because
of the pressing need to intensify the struggle, the growing viciousness
and use of terrorism by the regime, the ANC was going to relax the
single-minded preoccupation with avoiding civilian casualties in the
course of armed actions against legitimate targets.

This is a quote from Chris Hani, at the time MK Commissar, from a speech
broadcast on the ANC's Radio Freedom on March 1st, 1986: "We are saying
comrades (...) that our country is in a state of civil war. It is true
that so far the brunt of suffering has been borne by our people. Our
people are attending funerals, our people are mourning for their dead,
but comrades. Umkhonto we Sizwe, instructed by the leadership of the ANC,
is gearing itself to step up activity in white areas so that the entire
country should be ungovernable.
I want to elaborate on this question of extending the struggle to the
white areas. We don't want to be misunderstood. Unlike Botha. Le Grange,
Malan and Chris Heunis, who go out of their way to butcher children,
defenceless and unarmed children, old people, black civilians, Umkhonto
we Sizwe is a revolutionary army and is not going to embark on mayhem
against white civilians, against children, but we are going to step up
our attacks against enemy personnel. We are referring to the members of
the police force, to the members of the SADF, to those in the
administration terrorising and harassing our people, to those farmers and
other civilians who are part of the defence force of this country, the
military, paramilitary and reserves. The theatre of these actions is
going to be in the white residential areas, and it is inevitable that
white civilians will die." (BBC Monitoring Report) A factor which should
not be underestimated is that the banning by the regime of all ANC
literature and jamming of broadcasts from Radio Freedom made it difficult
for senior ANC leadership to get through to cadres and activists on the
ground t o ensure a proper understanding of policy. Every effort was made
to block and distort the ANC's message, or anything which could be
remotely construed as supportive of the message of the liberation
movement. An extraordinary range of items were banne d; possession of ANC
publications such as a pamphlet or a copy of Mayibuye or Sechaba could
result in a lengthy jail sentence.

Whilst the above statement provides a clear articulation of the ANC's
position, as we indicate elsewhere in this document, it is quite possible
that ambiguity in some of the formulations on this subject may have given
the impression to some cadres that they should totally disregard the
possibility of civilian casualties in the course of their operations. To
the extent that this occurred, we regret it. However, as again stated
elsewhere in this document and the main submission, where such
impressions were created resulting in operations out of kilter with the
ANC's policy, statements were issued and senior cadres tasked with
clarifying the position to commanders in the Forward Areas, and through
them, cadres on the ground.

Increasingly in this period, attacks took place in urban areas, in which
civilians were caught in the crossfire. Bona fide cadres and supporters
who carried out attacks of this nature believed they were fulfilling the
general direction to intensify the struggle and carry it into the white
areas in accordance with the political will of the leadership of the ANC.

With regard to the Ellis Park car bomb in 1988, about which the TRC has
asked a number of questions, the information required is contained in an
amnesty application. With regard to the explosion in Roodepoort outside a
branch of Standard Bank in 1988, at this stage the ANC does not know who
was responsible for this attack, and none of our cadres have applied for
amnesty in this regard. It was reported at the time that an ANC official
in Lusaka stated that a nearby SAP station, not civilians, had bee n the
target of this explosion; we have no details as to what operational
problems arose.

Anti-tank landmines and civilian casualties 

With regard to landmines, it must be emphasised that the ANC never used
anti-personnel mines, specifically because we were concerned to avoid
civilian casualties. The ANC used only anti-tank mines, which require at
least 300kg to detonate, because our primary targets were the military
patrols on roads immediately next to borders. The mines were laid
overnight so that they would be triggered when the SADF patrolled early
the next morning. It was reasoned that because farmworkers generally did
not have transport and moved around on foot, they were unlikely to be
affected.

As we stated in our main submission, cadres were under strict
instructions to do careful reconnaissance in order to avoid civilian
casualties, but it was often more difficult than anticipated to ensure
that civilians were not caught in these explosions; in some cases farm
workers travelling in heavy vehicles were killed or injured.

It is a fact - not an allegation or opinion of the ANC - that farmers in
Designated Areas (that is, declared military zones) were not considered
civilians by the regime itself, and were all active participants in overt
military networks. We provided considerable detail on the relevant
legislation in our first submission, on pp 59 - 60.

We do not have reliable statistics on how many people were killed in
landmine explosions for which the ANC was responsible. A rough estimate
based on available press reports shows that approximately thirty
explosions took place between November 1985 and July 1987 resulting in
about 23 deaths in total, including two cadres who were killed whilst
laying a mine. We reiterate our sincere regret that any civilian deaths
and injuries occurred.

Response of the leadership 

In late 1987, all members of MK HQ were called in by OR Tambo, who
expressed his concern at the number of unnecessary civilian casualties
which had occurred in certain attacks, particularly those involving the
use of anti-tank landmines. He tasked MK HQ with ensuring that all cadres
fully understood ANC policy with regard to legitimate targets. In
addition, MK HQ ordered that the laying of anti-tank mines should be
halted.

MK HQ sent senior commanders to the forward areas to meet with MK
structures there, and convey the concerns of the national leadership.
When possible these senior commanders also met with units. In cases where
meetings could not be held with units, command structures in the forward
areas were told to contact all command structures of their units, whether
they may have been involved in operations of this nature or not, and
ensure that all cadres were entirely clear on ANC policy regarding
legitimate targets. Chris Hani, Aboobaker Ismail and Keith Mokoape
visited structures in Maputo; Lambert Moloi, Chris Hani and Julius Maliba
("Manchecker") met with Zimbabwe structures, and Chris Hani, Aboobaker
Ismail, and Lambert Moloi visited Botswana structures. Ronnie Kasrils
visited structures in Swaziland.

In most cases cadres responsible for these actions had not deliberately
set out to flout ANC policy, but had believed they were acting in
accordance with the wishes of the leadership, or had acted in anger.
Conveying the instructions of the leadership in this unequivocal manner
through the most senior officials of MK HQ was sufficient action, as the
overwhelming majority of MK cadres were disciplined soldiers and
activists.

We remain convinced that some of these attacks were not carried out by
our cadres, but were the work of the regime itself. We again urge the TRC
to use its powers to obtain information of this nature from those who
would have been responsible for any actions of this nature, with the
objective of damaging the domestic and international image of the ANC. As
previously noted, Stratkom structures at national, regional and
departmental levels should be intensively investigated.

Conclusion 

Given the conditions in the 1980s, it is remarkable that so few armed
attacks took place in which there was a high rate of civilian casualties.
MK certainly had the capacity to kill many thousands of civilians. This
would have been easy to do; but we never took this route, even under
extreme provocation. When compared to the policies on armed actions
adopted by other national liberation movements on this and other
continents, the degree of restraint exercised by the ANC and MK is
extraordinary.

The humanity of the ANC's approach has never been acknowledged - nor
reciprocated - by the apartheid regime, which always defined black
civilians in general (and all those who opposed the regime) as "enemy
forces", whether they were armed or not.

The ANC largely concurs with the remark that landmines (particularly
anti-personnel mines) are indiscriminate weapons, although efforts were
always made by our cadres to avoid the deaths and injuries of civilians.
The thousands of anti-personnel landmines planted in Angola and
Mozambique by the former apartheid regime and its surrogates continue to
take their toll on civilians to this day. The recent banning of the sale
and manufacture of all anti- personnel landmines by the new government is
testimony to our belief that the use of these weapons is in conflict with
a society committed to the building of a human rights culture.

As stated in our main submission, the ANC takes collective responsibility
for all bona fide MK actions. We regret the deaths and injuries to
civilians arising from MK's armed actions. We apologise to their families
and next-of-kin for the suffering and hurt that these actions caused.
Where applicable, MK cadres have their applications for amnesty with
regard to these actions.

3. ALLEGATIONS REGARDING EXCESSES AGAINST CADRES AND CAPTURED AGENTS, AND
STEPS TAKEN TO HALT THESE PRACTICES 

The Commission has asked what, in our opinion, were the weaknesses of the
Security Sector of the Department of National Intelligence and Security
(NAT) which may have led to violations of human rights. We have also been
asked a number of questions regarding specific incidents, and on action
taken by the leadership of the ANC to correct these problems. 

The TRC has asked us to whom cases of abuse of certain prisoners, and the
steadily deteriorating physical conditions of this camp, were reported.
The NEC discussed these problems on a number of occasions before 1985,
and has asked whether documentation to this effect is available. 

The TRC has also asked several questions regarding the functioning of all
tribunals, and the cases they considered. 

The TRC has asked how many mutineers died in the Pango mutiny; their
names; the exact circumstances under which they died; they cite the
Stuart Commission, which gives details about the shootings of two people
by security personnel on 07/02/84. They refer to Khotso Morena, who was
shot and seriously injured when running away after exploding a hand
grenade. Were mutineers travelling to Viana ambushed by ANC officials?
How many prisoners were taken after the mutiny? How many of them were
transferred to Morris Seabelo Rehabilitation Centre? 

Introduction 

In our main submission to the Commission, we acknowledged that some
excesses had occurred in the treatment of captured agents, and apologised
for these incidents. The matter of violations which did take place in
Camp 32 (also known as the Morris Seabelo Rehabilitation Centre, or
Quatro) and other camps had been a source of serious concern within the
ANC, when information reached the leadership and other structures. The
reports of four past commissions of inquiry appointed by the ANC
leadership to look into allegations of abuse provides concrete evidence
of their concern.

The perception that abuses which took place were systematic or widespread
is wrong. Those members of the security department of the Department of
National Intelligence and Security (NAT) who abused prisoners did so in
violation of ANC policy: there was nothing "systematic" about such acts.
NAT personnel were given comprehensive and professional training in
security and intelligence work in socialist and other countries. The
suggestion that any cadre of the ANC was trained specifically in torture
is rejected with contempt.

In addressing the questions raised by the TRC, we will use the reports of
past commissions of inquiry appointed by the ANC as a primary point of
reference, and occasionally augment the findings of these commissions
with other available information. (These reports were presented to the
TRC with our first submission, and were also released to the public.)

We will concentrate on presenting our understanding of how circumstances
arose in which excesses in violation of ANC policy took place, in line
with the mandate of the TRC to establish the truth and ensure that
conditions under which such violations took place are never allowed to
recur.

First, we will briefly sketch the backdrop against which some of these
excesses took place. Agents infiltrated into our structures carried out
acts such as the attempted mass poisoning of cadres, supplying
intelligence which led to the bombardment of one of our camps, sabotage
of equipment and deliberate attempts to encourage indiscipline and
internal conflict of various kinds. There were a number of cases in which
agents supplied their handlers with information which led directly to the
assassinations of leaders and the ambushing or arrest, torture, and
imprisonment of cadres.

NAT uprooted the regime's most prized network of infiltrators in 1981.
Analysis of the activities of some of these agents in the political
context in which they took place indicated that they were not merely
involved in various attempts to disrupt or damage the ANC, but were
actors in a far broader and more ambitious operation by the regime to
eliminate and replace key leaders of the ANC, thereby setting the
movement on a new route which would culminate in its destruction. (A copy
of the "Shishita report", which covers this investigation in detail, has
been submitted to the TRC.)

This was a severe setback which thoroughly rattled the regime. Their
response was a desperate attempt to "jam" our screening procedures by
throwing large numbers of infiltrators into the field. Many if not most
would-be infiltrators in the post-Shishita period were hopelessly
ill-prepared for the missions their handlers had assigned to them. For
example, one confessed that he had been told to attempt to assassinate OR
Tambo - but had not been supplied with a weapon, or any other form of
logistical support such as a plan to retreat after the operation. Others
- such as Patrick Dlongwana - had been so thoroughly exposed inside the
country, that his handlers must have known he would be picked up
immediately. It appears the regime hoped the ANC's machineries would be
overwhelmed by this influx, which would to some extent serve to divert
our resources away from prosecuting the armed struggle inside the
country, and create conditions under which the more professional
infiltrators they deployed might slip through the net.

Means to deal with this influx of agents had to be devised. As the NAT
Operations report shows, nearly 40% of confessed agents were never
imprisoned. But others were dangerous, or had committed such serious
crimes that they had to be isolated. It is in this context that Camp 32
was established, and cases in which excesses on which the TRC has
requested more information occurred.

3.1 LINES OF COMMAND AND ACCOUNTABILITY 

As the organigrams accompanying this document show, the National
Executive Committee (NEC) has always been the ANC's highest policy- and
decision- making body. The National Security Council and the
Revolutionary Council fell under the Office of the President, with the
various military, political and security structures, committees or
departments reporting to the Revolutionary Council. NAT - as the
Department of Intelligence and Security was generally known - was no
exception.

In the 1970s and the early 1980s there was significant overlap between MK
and NAT structures, particularly in Angola. Mzwai Piliso was the most
senior leader in charge of all camps in Angola, and was also appointed
head of NAT, of which the Security department was one sub-sector, in 1981.

NAT slowly developed towards more clear-cut lines of command,
specialisation of work, and separation of functions; more details in this
regard are supplied in the operational report. In the early 1980s,
confusion set in as the role of the Security Department (and NAT in
general in Angola) veered away from what should have been its central
function - gathering intelligence and screening recruits to protect MK
and the ANC as a whole - towards taking on largely disciplinary roles
and, at Camp 32, guard duties.

In dealing with the question of the weaknesses that emerged over time, it
is therefore necessary to also look at the situation in Angola in general.

3.2. ANGOLA, 1977 - 1984; DISCIPLINE IN MK 

Discipline is the cornerstone of any army. MK was guided by the ANC's
Code of Conduct, a copy of which was attached to our first submission.
Breaches of discipline common to most armies were usually handled at camp
level by the camp command structure; these were cases such as fighting
between cadres, abuse of authority, disregard of camp rules, going AWOL,
petty theft, exchanging camp property for liquor, drug abuse (mostly
dagga) and illicit liquor brewing. Punishments for offences of this
nature were laid out in the Code of Conduct (see p. 89 of our first
submission.) Sometimes the punishments meted out for contraventions of
the MK Code of Conduct were entirely out of proportion to the deed.

This is a regrettable feature of many armies. While we would never wish
to compare MK - a guerrilla army composed entirely of volunteers - with
the SADF, which relied on forced conscription, we feel it should be
pointed out that a number of SADF conscripts are known to have died after
brutal beatings; other forms of punishment and ill-treatment (such as
excessive "paal PT" ) resulted in deaths. There were a number of minor
mutinies; in 1979, there was a mass walkout of over 60 SADF soldiers from
their base in Upington in protest at the treatment they were receiving.

In six cases between 1979 and 1981, MK cadres died as a result of being
beaten. (A list of these names has been submitted to the TRC.) Reports on
these incidents would be sent to the Camp Commander, and senior officials
would meet with the Camp Administration to hold an inquiry into the
incident to prevent recurrence of such excessive actions. Measures such
as demotion or redeployment would be taken against perpetrators of
excessive punishments.

The case of Joel Mahlatini provides a good example of the manner in which
the ANC leadership handled cases of this nature. Mahlatini was severely
beaten on the orders of his Camp Commander, Kenneth Mahamba; he was dead
on arrival at Camp 32. The leadership took this incident so seriously
that an inquiry was instituted, which facilitated the uncovering of the
spy network some years later, of which Mahamba was a leading member.
After exhaustive investigations of their cases, trial by Tribunal, and a
final decision by the NEC, Justice Tshabalala, Jabu Zikalala, Vusi
Mayekiso and Kenneth Mahamba were executed. Other members of this network
- Dick Khumalo, Escom Maluleka, John Maleke, and Drake Chiloane were
executed later after the same process had been followed. There were other
cases over the years of executions of agents after investigations into
their cases, the sitting of a tribunal, and a final decision by the
political leadership. A list of these names has been submitted to the TRC.

Serious breaches in discipline by MK cadres at times resulted in capital
punishment. It must be emphasised that there were no cases of summary or
unauthorised execution.

Before a tribunal was held, Military HQ in Lusaka would be informed of
the case by the Regional Command structures. The NEC would appoint at
least one senior official to sit on the tribunal with officials from MHQ
and the Regional Command. In some cases local authorities were also
involved in this process. The tribunal would report its findings to HQ,
where a final decision would be made.

Between 1981 and 1989, four cadres were executed for murder and rape of
Angolan women, four for murder, and in 1989, one was executed for rape.
(A list of these names has been submitted to the TRC.) Those who were
executed for rape and murder were imprisoned for around two months whilst
the leadership consulted with the Angolan authorities on the manner in
which these crimes should be handled. They were publicly executed with
fellow- villagers of the murdered women and local government officials
present.

The only other occasion on which capital punishment was carried out on MK
cadres was at the time of the Pango mutiny in 1984. Before dealing with
the questions posed by the TRC in this regard, we will deal with the
background to this incident by describing the situation as it developed
in Angola.

Growing tensions in the camps 

Many of the problems which arose in military camps in Angola at this time
were the result of the tensions between the ANC's policy on armed
struggle, and the intense frustration felt by recruits who had flocked to
MK in the wake of the 1976 uprising when they were not immediately
deployed inside the country after initial military training. Since 1979
the ANC had elaborated its policy perspectives in this regard, and
believed that military struggle was secondary to building the base for
mass political struggle within the country.

To quote from the "Green Book": 10a) (...) the armed struggle must be
based on, and grow out of, mass political support...All military
activities must, at every stage, be guided and determined by the need to
generate political mobilisation, organisation and resistance..."
b) The forms of political and military activities, and the way these
activities relate to one another go through different phases as the
situation changes. It is therefore vital to have under continuous survey
the changing tactical relationships between these two inter-dependent
factors in our struggle...The concrete political realities must determine
whether, at any given stage and in any given region, the main emphasis
should be on political or on military action." Many recruits wanted
desperately to just go home and fight, underestimated the difficulty of
the logistics involved in infiltrating them safely into the country, and
did not appreciate the rationale behind the leadership's approach.

In late 1977, a group of fourteen cadres who had just completed their
initial six-month military training at Novo Katengue camp demanded to be
sent to the front immediately. They refused all orders, and also refused
to go on an advanced training course. They were sent to Quibaxe, where
they were excused from classes but had to contribute to normal camp
duties. Again, they refused to obey orders.

A Tribunal was convened, and seven of them were sentenced to one month's
imprisonment, the others to two months. In addition, they had to carry
out tasks such as digging trenches. After they had completed their
sentences they were accepted unconditi onally back into MK structures.
Sworn affidavits (made in 1993) from all of these cadres have been
submitted to the TRC. These expose allegations that a serious mutiny was
put down by troops trained in the GDR, and that cadres were subsequently
ill- treated by Ronnie Kasrils, as deliberate disinformation typical of
the propaganda in the report of the Douglas "commission", a stratkom
exercise covertly funded with taxpayers' money.

A similar incident took place in 1979 at Fazenda, when about fifteen
cadres demanded to go to the front, refused to be disarmed, and fired
shots at night. They wanted to go to Luanda to meet the ANC leadership to
demand immediate deployment. This "mutiny" was solved politically by
Mzwai Piliso and Moses Mabhida, who talked to the cadres. There was no
violence and these cadres were allowed to remain in MK structures. For
some cadres, a deep sense of depression set in after spending too many
years in camps in Angola. In the words of the Stuart Commission report:
"The Commission believes that the conditions in the camps, the total
isolation from the outside world, the desperation and frustration of not
being deployed, make it practically impossible for cadres to survive
(politically, morally, and psychologically) in the camps for several
years." This problem was exacerbated by steadily decreasing attention to
the camps in the early 1980s - both political and in terms of providing
basic resources - by the seriously overstretched national leadership in
Lusaka. In the words of the report of the Commission, "over the years,
visits to the camps by the leadership has decreased significantly. This
has affected not only the national leadership but surprisingly also the
regional leadership. The latter tend increasingly to spend more time in
Luanda than in the camps."

Apart from these problems, general conditions in the camps were at times
difficult. Food supplies were at times inadequate, and bandits
specifically targeted supply lines from Angolan ports, exacerbating the
situation. Medical supplies and other essential items were not always
readily available. Tropical diseases, particularly malaria, were rife,
and there were too few doctors in Angola to adequately service all the
those in the camps - cadres and prisoners alike. Access to clean water
supplies was almost always a serious problem.

Angola was a war zone. The constant threat to ANC camps and cadres from
UNITA bandits was yet another source of tension and difficulty. Many
cadres were killed in operations against UNITA, and these deaths and
injuries were a factor which had direct bearing on the 1984 mutiny.
Certain agents also deliberately played on these incidents to create
demoralisation and mistrust of the ANC leadership.

The delays in committing the majority of cadres to battle affected not
only recruits but commanders as well, particularly after the destruction
of Nova Katengue, which had been in many respects a model of the kind of
camp the ANC wanted to maintain.

In addition to these factors, by the end of 1983, according to the report
of the Stuart Commission, a range of practices had set in which had
seriously corroded the ANC's vision of its army, and which had direct
bearing on the mutinies. Some members of camp administrations had begun
to abuse their powers; cadres felt they were no longer being consulted
sufficiently, and that their concerns were not being properly conveyed to
the leadership in Lusaka; an intolerance of valid criticism had
developed. In addition, there was insufficient provision for cultural
activities and regular briefing on current events inside the country.
There was poor management of human resources, and a belief that unfair
decisions regarding deployment were being made; this resulted in much
frustration.

One of the key factors which contributed to a drop in standards in
general in Angola in the early 1980s was the deployment of many senior
and experienced cadres out of Angola into machineries in the Forward
Areas or inside the country to develop the armed struggle. This meant
that much younger cadres with less experience had to take over their
positions.

As a result of all of these factors problems arose in the camps, and
disciplinary measures also fell short of the ideals the Movement had
always aspired to.

The Pango mutiny, 1984 

The lead-up to the Pango mutiny, particularly the mutiny at Viana transit
camp in February 1984, has been described in considerable detail in the
report of the Motsuenyane Commission (pp. 37 - 40.) The question asked by
the TRC regarding the exact circumstances in which the mutineers died,
making reference to the cases of Diliza Dumakude, Zihlangu Zanempi
(referred to as Salier Janemzi), and Khotso Morena indicates that some
confusion has arisen. The Pango mutiny could be described as having two
phases.

In the first phase, cadres who had been refusing to accept military
discipline and firing in the air were sent to Viana transit camp after
senior officials spoke to them. The allegation made in the report of the
Douglas "commission" to the effect that some cadres were "ambushed by ANC
officials" is untrue. Some of those who arrived in Viana remained
mutinous and refused to be disarmed. When a second, larger group of
cadres arrived, they too refused to be disarmed. Subsequent events are
described in some detail in the report of the Stuart Commission on p 22.
Vuyisile Maseko and Khotso Morena were captured but the security
personnel were unaware that Maseko had a grenade; he set it off in the
car, but all the occupants were able to escape. Morena ran straight for a
tent in which arms and explosives were kept; both Chris Hani and Joe
Modise were very close by, addressing cadres, and it was clear that their
lives could be in danger. Morena refused to stop when he was ordered to
give himself up and was shot.

After intervention by Angolan security forces order at Viana camp was
restored. The mutineers were disarmed and agreed to be relocated to
Pango. There a group of them secretly planned to seize the camp arsenal
and mutiny again.

The Pango mutiny occurred in mid-May 1984. The mutineers systematically
killed most members of the camp administration, using heavy calibre
weapons. In all, eight MK cadres were killed by the mutineers, in some
cases in cold blood the morning after the mutiny had begun, when they
hunted down those who had been wounded and were hiding in the bush.

The camp was recaptured by loyal cadres; in the shoot-out seven mutineers
were killed. Others fled the camp; one was found dead some days later
when cadres were fetching firewood; he had committed suicide with a
pistol, which was found next to his body. One captured mutineer died of
malaria before the military tribunal was convened; he refused to accept
treatment for his illness. Two cadres escaped from the camp when it was
recaptured, and have not been heard of since.

A military tribunal was appointed and convened on 22/05/84. Available
documentation on the deliberations of the tribunal have been submitted to
the TRC.

Sixty-six people testified before the tribunal. Of these, the tribunal
recommended that sixteen mutineers should receive the death penalty,
while the others were either recommended for demobilisation or were
acquitted and referred to the camp disciplinary committee to face lesser
charges.

Seven mutineers were executed by firing squad. The others were spared
after the leadership reconsidered the decision to execute them, and were
instead imprisoned at Camp 32. In all, twenty-three mutineers were
imprisoned until 1989, while four were imprisoned for a short time and
released in 1984. A list of the names of all those who died during the
mutiny and those who were executed has been submitted to the TRC.

Response of the leadership: the Stuart Commission of Inquiry 

As a result of these events, the Stuart Commission was appointed to
inquire into the causes of the mutinies, consisting of Hermanus Loots
("James Stuart"), Aziz Pahad, Sizakele Sigxashe and Mtu Jwili. (The
latter two later became heads of Directorates in the restructured NAT.)
The Commission presented its report to all members of the NEC in March
1984 (before the more serious mutiny erupted at Pango.)

By this time, the preliminary briefings of the Commission had already
convinced the leadership about the need for a National Conference of the
ANC to discuss matters pertaining to the intensification of struggle
generally, as well as the problems in the camps.

The Commission found that while some of those most directly involved in
the mutinies had long histories of disruptive and destructive behavior,
and also had "illusions of power and leadership", the mutinous behaviour
which had occurred by February 1984 could not be described as "an
organized act of conspiracy on the part of the enemy".

In its painfully incisive assessment of conditions in Angola, the Stuart
Commission report noted that since 1979 nearly all petty offences had
been dealt with in a destructive manner "as distinct from the earlier
revolutionary constructive punishment" which sought essentially to
rehabilitate offenders rather than crush them. The report of the
Commission notes that the "tragic fact is that it was at its worst in the
training camps."

Grievances against the Security department also came to the fore in this
report. In the words of the report, "interviews carried out by the
Commission in all our camps reflect one unanimous response: that the
security department carried out tasks which are not supposed to be theirs
- the task of disciplining offenders." Instead of concentrating on its
role as an intelligence service, dedicated to exposing agents and
protecting the ANC in general, it had become a "military police" force
within the camps. At times such actions took place "without consultation
or approval by other (members of the) camp administration."

It is also clear from this report that a lack of clear policy guidelines,
and clear lines of command, contributed directly to the ANC's failure to
halt abuse. It recommended that the NEC should "clearly define the tasks
and powers" of the Security Department, draw up a Code of Conduct to
govern the behaviour of these cadres and ensure it was enforced, and
"formally and categorically prohibit(s) the use of violence and torture
by the Security Department (as well as other officers in camps)", re
deploy "notorious security men", and "adopt a coherent policy with regard
to captured enemy agents."

Excesses in relation to captured and imprisoned agents and mutineers 

Both the Skweyiya and Motsuenyane Commissions were told that prisoners at
Camp 32 had been subjected to serious abuse. It is necessary to point out
that while some of the allegations made to the Skweyiya Commission were
true, others were deliberate attempts to mislead the Commission, and
members of the Department accused of abuses were not given the
opportunity to reply to these allegations; hence the establishment of the
Motsuenyane Commission.

The report of the Skweyiya Commission notes that Mzwai Piliso, head of
Personnel and Training as well as of the Security Department at the time,
"candidly" admitted that he had personally participated in beating a
suspect in 1981 on the basis that a plot to kill members of the
leadership had been discovered and he wanted information "at any cost."

It is clear that setting an example of this nature would have affected
the behaviour of other members of the security department. These factors
are also relevant:
* some of these cadres had themselves been subjected to very brutal
  treatment by the apartheid security police before leaving the country
  for training;
* the need to obtain information quickly was at times a factor which
  led to the beating of unco-operative captives, such as Keith McKenzie,
  who had placed a car bomb somewhere in Botswana: in this case the
  urgency to obtain information was fuelled by the desire to prevent
  deaths by locating the bomb in time;7
* there was anger against some of these prisoners, who have tended to
  be all uncritically portrayed as innocent victims: several had
  committed vicious, cold-blooded acts of murder, usually in the service
  of the apartheid regime, against anti-apartheid activists inside and
  outside the country.
It is unreasonable to expect people to deal with situations for which
they have no training, particularly when they are young and
inexperienced. Most members of staff at various rehabilitation centres
were very young cadres who had left the country to join MK. They were not
trained as Military Police or prison warders. The training they received
was the same as that of all MK cadres, while some underwent more
specialised training in intelligence work from the late 1970s onwards.
But none were trained specifically for the roles they had to take on -
very unwillingly at times.

It was necessary but undesirable work; as a former member of staff at
Camp 32 put it, most cadres in these postings had "joined the ANC and the
army with the sole purpose of training and getting back home to engage
the enemy for the liberation of the country, but because of the tasks
they were called upon to perform in this camp, had to lose all those
possibilities of ever going to the front, going for further training, and
enjoying other privileges enjoyed by others".

Structures in Angola had to rely on other structures in the forward areas
and inside the country to provide information necessary to carry out
proper investigations. Because of the weakness of some of these
structures, and the long lines of communication, several persons
classified as suspects took a long time to be cleared.

Conclusions 

To summarise, the report of the 1984 Stuart Commission makes it clear
that in some respects Angola, "generally regarded as a reliable rear base
of our struggle...(had) been used as a dumping ground for enemy agents,
suspects, malcontents and undisciplined elements". The report also shows
that in some respects the ANC leadership did not take adequate steps to
ensure effective management of its military camps, which included
ensuring that cadres deployed in these camps had policy guidelines to
work by, understood their "line functions", and were under clear lines of
command and control.

Whether this kind of management was possible given the conditions under
which the ANC was working at the time - particularly in Angola, which was
a war zone - is questionable. Nevertheless, stronger action to halt the
excesses described in the report of the Stuart Commission could have been
taken, and in this regard, the ANC again expresses regret at this state
of affairs and its consequences.

3.3. MEASURES TO HALT EXCESSES AND CONTINUING PROBLEM AREAS, 1985 - 1990  

As we noted in our first submission, the ANC took a range of steps to
halt abuses. Within a few weeks of the tabling of the report of the
Stuart Commission, nearly all its recommendations had been adopted and
were in the first stages of implementation.

Most critical in this regard, and as the first major policy action, the
1985 National Consultative Conference in Kabwe took a range of decisions
on all these matters. (It is worth noting that 40% of the delegates at
the Conference were from the camps, and they submitted presentations on
problems in Angola.) The ANC elaborated the existing Code of Conduct ,
and established the Office of Justice, reinforced the existing Review
Board, and established the National People's Tribunal.

Mzwai Piliso was removed from his post as head of NAT to concentrate on
other duties. Andrew Masondo was censured by the leadership, and the post
of National Commissar was abolished; in addition, he lost his post on the
NEC. Both performed well and with loyalty to the ANC in their new
postings.

Procedures of the new structures for justice 

Previously tribunals had been constituted as needed. They had been
convened to try suspected agents, to decide on punishments for cadres who
had committed offences as defined in the MK Code of Conduct, and to deal
with the mutineers. In all cases, senior political office-bearers would
be appointed to tribunals by the NEC, who served along with high-ranking
MK officers such as regional Commanders and Commissars. The report of the
Stuart Commission recommended that a formally constituted, independent
and specialised structure was necessary. As a result, the National
People's Tribunal was established.

The TRC has asked several specific questions on the functions of the new
structures for justice. The first National People's Tribunal was
appointed soon after the Kabwe Conference. Hermanus Loots was the chair,
with Shadrack Pekane, and Z.N. Jobodwana as the other members. The latter
two were lawyers. This structure was tasked with overseeing and making
judgements on the basis of investigations carried out by NAT. It was
fully independent: there was no formal link between the Tribunal and any
other ANC structures, including the Office of the President.

The Tribunal followed procedures laid down by lawyers in the ANC's Legal
and Constitutional Affairs department, which were in essence the same
procedures followed in South African courts. Persons accused of offences
would be summoned to the Tribunal. There were prosecuting lawyers, and
every accused would be represented by one or two lawyers, who had access
to the charge sheet in order to prepare their defence. At the end of the
proceedings both sides would summarise the evidence presented and the
Tribunal would adjourn. This process often took two to three days to
complete.

The Tribunal could recommend one or a combination of the following lines
of action:
* that the accused be released; in these cases, the person concerned
  would be handed over to the Office of Justice, which would ensure that
  s/he was taken to the place of her/his choice; for example, some would
  prefer to leave Angola and be re-established in Zambia or Tanzania in
  the ANC civilian community. In some cases those who decided they wanted
  to leave the ANC would be handed over to the Chief Representative in
  the relevant country, who would assist the person concerned to apply
  for asylum in a host country.
* that the suspect be expelled from the Movement; in these cases, the
  suspect would be handed over to the host government by the Office of
  the Chief Representative, and the host government would hand the person
  on to the UNHCR.
* in cases where the accused was found guilty s/he could be sentenced
  to a period of imprisonment at the Rehabilitation Centre
* in cases where the accused was found guilty of a capital offence, the
  death sentence could be recommended.
The sentence recommended by the Tribunal was referred to the President,
who would usually refer the case to the Review Board, which was tasked
with acting as a court of appeal with the powers to confirm or change the
decision of the Tribunal as the members of the Board saw fit. Only after
the Review Board had considered the case would sentence be confirmed (or
set aside) by the President.

The Review Board was also tasked with regularly reviewing cases and
making recommendations to the NEC as to whether prisoners should be
released or not. Their work was considerably facilitated by the adoption
of the elaborated Code of Conduct .

The chair of the Review Board was Dan Tloome; Ruth Mompati and John
Motshabi made up the rest of the Board. The Board would from time to time
set up groups of senior ANC figures to conduct inspections and report
back to the leadership. We regret that we have not been able to locate
the documentation relevant to the work of the Review Board; if specific
questions regarding the work of the Review Board arise, the ANC will
assist the TRC in this regard.

In addition to these structures for justice, there was a Presidential
Council to which those whose cases had been considered by the Tribunal
and Review Board could appeal if they were unhappy about the decisions of
these structures. This council, which consisted of the President, John
Nkadimeng, Dan Tloome and later, Joe Slovo, could set aside sentences and
grant pardons.

Steps were also taken to ensure that clearer lines of command were in
place over NAT personnel working in Angola. At a meeting held in Lusaka
in 1986 between NAT and MK delegations, chaired by OR Tambo, it was
agreed that NAT cadres fell only under the authority of the NAT
Directorate, and that MK structures in the region should not make any
unilateral decisions affecting NAT line functions. Whilst MK structures
did not usually issue any orders directly affecting the welfare of
prisoners and suspects, tensions had arisen due to confusion in the lines
of command.

The NAT Directorate itself also took steps to improve the conditions
under which prisoners were held in response to the directives of the
leadership. A report written by the head of the Recording Department in
November 1987 which highlights the difficulties of extending Camp 32
facilities given the physical terrain, and argues that the camp should
instead be closed altogether and transferred to a more convenient place,
has been submitted to the TRC. A report on a visit to Camp 32 in December
1987 by a member of the NAT Directorate has also been submitted to the
TRC. Three deaths took place in Camp 32 during the first half of 1987,
and a Commission was appointed to investigate the circumstances in which
these deaths took place; the report of this Commission has been handed to
the TRC.

The report of the Skweyiya Commission notes that it took some time before
the measures provided for in the Code of Conduct were implemented
properly. Zola Skweyiya was appointed Officer of Justice in 1986, and
also had the responsibility of established in the ANC's Legal and
Constitutional Affairs department. He reported directly to the President.

He experienced considerable difficulties in fulfilling all these roles
for a range of reasons, including a shortage of staff, and a degree of
unco-operativeness from the head of NAT. Whilst Mzwai Piliso fully
accepted the decisions taken at the Kabwe Conference, given the degree of
pressure he was under on various fronts, he was distinctly unenthusiastic
about dealing with the complex and time-consuming logistics involved in
flying staff of the Office of Justice into Angola to interview all
prisoners and review their cases. However, when Zola Skweyiya approached
the President to facilitate this visit, the President took immediate
action to "unblock" bureaucratic channels, and Joe Nhlanhla in his
capacity as Secretary of the Politco-Military Committee (PMC) played a
central role in ensuring that the Office of Justice received all
necessary support.

The 1988 Tribunal in Luanda 

In May 1988 (not 1987, as stated in the report of the Motsuenyane
Commission) the Office of Justice arranged a sitting of the National
People's Tribunal in Luanda (not at Camp 32, as stated in the report of
the Motsuenyane Commission.) This Tribunal reviewed the cases of
twenty-five prisoners held by the ANC at this time, including some of
those who had confessed to being enemy agents. Hermanus Loots chaired the
Tribunal. Penuell Maduna acted as defence lawyer for the prisoners, and
pleaded on their behalf. Mr Loots has pointed out that members of NAT who
worked with this Tribunal had a "very positive attitude" towards the
committee and gave their full co- operation.

In seven of the cases heard, the Tribunal concluded that the "possible
sentence" would be imprisonment; in the view of members of the Tribunal,
the evidence against them left no doubt that they were guilty of the
crimes for which they had been imprisoned. In two cases the "possible
sentence" recommended by the Tribunal was capital punishment; in seven
cases judgement was reserved; and they recommended that two cases be re-
investigated.

In seven cases, the Tribunal recommended release as it was felt that
there was insufficient concrete evidence against these accused. Six had
been imprisoned in 1987, whilst the seventh recommended for release had
been imprisoned since 1982. With regard to the group of six, members of
the Tribunal privately felt it was very probable that these prisoners
were indeed guilty; the NAT investigators were entirely convinced of
this, and were very unhappy at this recommendation for release.

However, the Tribunal stuck rigidly to its mandate and argued before the
NEC that they should be released, since the evidence against the six had
not been led properly. The group was released. This case is a good
illustration of the tensions between the ANC's desire to act in
accordance with accepted legal procedures and the abnormal circumstances
in which we were attempting to put such high standards into practice. (A
report-back by NAT structures on the procedures of this Tribunal has been
submitted to the TRC. This document also answers the TRC's questions
regarding the background of those released.)

Post 1987: a new NAT 

By the time of the appointment of a commission of inquiry into the death
of Thami Zulu in late 1989, the new NAT leadership had been in place for
some time.

In the words of the report, "there has been a process of major
reorganisation of the security department, with notable improvements in
the conditions of detainees." Violence was expressly forbidden, and a
member of the department who had assaulted a detainee had been recently
sentenced to a five-year term of imprisonment by the Tribunal, which sat
in Lusaka. The commissioners inspected the rehabilitation centre and
noted that "the general conditions for detainees, poor as they were, had
improved immeasurably compared with their truly parlous situation before
Comrade Nhlanhla had taken over."

The report also notes that according to a friend of Thami Zulu's,
although he was indignant about the investigation, "he made no mention of
physical abuse (...) We have no reason to believe he was subjected to
torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment." In fact, Zulu told
his colleagues in the military that he had not been tortured, and his
parents and family visited him on more than one occasion during the
period that he was confined.

The commissioners also questioned "at length and with some rigour"
members of the department who had been responsible at various times for
interrogating Zulu, and generally undertook a thorough review of the
investigation and the methods used. They concluded that they were
"satisfied that the investigation panels worked in a systematic and
objective manner, probing all the pros and cons of every question. They
were not clumsy cops, but skilled interrogators who prepared carefully,
basing themselves on logic, probabilities and attention to detail. What
impressed us particularly was their willingness to take into account
factors which could prove favourable to TZ's position." The commissioners
also noted cases in which the department had "carefully cross-checked"
allegations by taking action such as arranging an identification parade.
(Documents relevant to the investigations carried out by NAT in this case
have been submitted to the TRC.)

Two months after Zulu had been confined, the panel reported that although
it had found no conclusive proof that he had been collaborating with the
enemy, there were "some matters in relation to which he had been unable
to give convincing answers" but these could only be cleared up by
obtaining information from the Swaziland special branch - probably an
impossible task at the time. It recommended that Zulu be disciplined for
criminal neglect in the case of the June 1988 deaths of nine cadres under
his command, who had been ambushed and shot dead by police soon after
crossing the Swaziland border near Piet Retief.

The report notes that despite many improvements, some of the critically
important measures introduced after the Kabwe Conference were not
functioning as well as it had been hoped: "while considerable progress
has been made, the Code has not been fully implemented and the situation
of legality inside the ANC falls short of what the Conference called
for." In addition, there was no regulations to govern periods of
investigation; as the report puts it, "witnesses from Security themselves
asked for a clear set of norms governing detention, since they feel torn
between the conflicting objectives of not giving up their investigations
until irrefutable proofs or disproofs existed and not prolonging their
inquires in an undue manner."

Conclusions 

Among the findings and conclusions of the Motsuenyane Commission,
appointed in 1993, and which examined the period from the late 1970s to
1985, were the following:
* " Concerns (of MK cadres in Angola) were voiced but not properly
  addressed by the leadership, which resulted in mutinies."
* "Quatro was conceived without proper deliberation. It was located in
  Angola, a country at war, and was staffed by inadequately trained
  youths of insufficient experience. The first camp commander was only 19
  years old. The failure to train adequately and supervise the staff, the
  lack of clear authority between Mbokodo and MK, and the breakdown in
  communications between the prison and the Officer of Justice resulted
  in many abuses of human rights."
* The leadership did implement mechanisms to address these problems,
  mainly the Code of Conduct and the Office of Justice; this "system of
  justice represented by the structures in the Code of Conduct was unique
  among liberation movements in Southern Africa", comments the report
  elsewhere, and "represented a large step forward in respect of human
  rights protection within the ANC"; however, "the leadership did not
  follow these measures through sufficiently." "The absence of clear
  lines of demarcation between the powers and responsibilities of
  Umkhonto we Sizwe and Mbokodo resulted in a lack of accountability for
  the excesses that occurred at Quatro (...) The failure to incorporate
  Mbokodo properly into the structures of the ANC created a degree of
  independence and unaccountability for the Security apparatus which was
  detrimental to the overall interests of the Organisation."
The ANC concurs with these findings, which largely confirm the findings
of earlier inquiries appointed by the ANC itself.

It is perhaps necessary to remind the Commission of the conditions under
which the ANC was operating. The ANC was a banned organisation, and every
effort was made to destroy it. The Movement did not have the resources of
a state; it had limited material means, and was operating in impoverished
and developing countries where apparently elementary necessities were
very difficult to organise. Communications were unreliable and
intensively monitored; transport was always a problem. Angola was in the
grip of a devastating civil war in which UNITA bandits were receiving the
support of South Africa and certain Western countries. To travel in
Angola in certain areas was a life-threatening exercise. All these
factors contributed significantly to the lack of effective management of
structures in general, particularly in Angola.

With regard to various questions asked by the TRC on interventions by
individual leadership figures, all officials, whether specifically tasked
to or not, were obliged to halt any activities which were in conflict
with ANC policy on the treatment of prisoners. We have tried to describe
to the Commission how the ANC's policies evolved to ensure that justice
was done and the human rights of prisoners were protected; in this regard
the ANC acted collectively, not as a result of individual interventions.

Various phases in the ANC's attempts to deal with the problems which
arose must be distinguished. It was between 1981 - 1985 that most of the
excesses took place: this is the period covered by both the Skweyiya and
Motsuenyane Commissions. As noted in the findings of the Motsuenyane
Commission, the adoption of the Code of Conduct at the Kabwe Conference
"showed that the leadership of the ANC was gravely concerned with the
need to correct the indentified wrongs once these had been properly
investigated." Steps were taken but there was weakness in implementing
these decisions. Between 1985 - 1987, codes of conduct and policy
guidelines had been adopted and mechanisms were set up to ensure
implementation of these decisions. While the ANC had limited resources,
we submit that we used what we had well, and that there was steady
improvement in the structures established to ensure justice was done.

The period from 1987 - 1990, when a new leadership was in place -
provisionally under the Secretary-General, and later on a permanent basis
under Joe Nhlanhla - was characterised by ever-greater vigour in ensuring
the protection (at great expense) of the human rights of hard-core agents
who had been involved in atrocities within and outside the country.

With regard to the ANC's decision to appoint the Mostsuenyane Commission
in 1993 - which cost us R3 million - the Commissioners commented in their
conclusions "It would be wrong to ignore the historic significance of the
investigation the ANC, through this Commission, has undertaken, a first
in the annals of human rights enforcement. By its commitment to this
inquiry, the ANC seeks to breathe life into the lofty principles
proclaimed in the Freedom Charter - to render fundamental human rights
the Golden Rule, to be applied in good times and bad, peace and war" (p.
171.)

The ANC acknowledges that more could have been done in all the periods
under review. And, to the extent that we violated the human rights of
prisoners and suspects, the ANC again expresses regret and apologises to
those who were subjected to ill-treatment, to their families, and to the
nation. Above all the ANC apologises to all who were wrongfully accused
of working with the apartheid regime and other hostile agencies.

3.5. ADDITIONAL NOTES RELEVANTTO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE TRC 

3.5.1 The Commission has asked how the ANC justifies the fact that Mzwai
Piliso and Andrew Masondo retained senior posts in the post-1994
administration. 

Both Mzwai Piliso and Andrew Masondo were seriously censured by the
leadership of the ANC, as described above. These officials both performed
well and with loyalty to the ANC in their new postings.

In addition, an ailing Mzwai Piliso had to testify to both the Skweyiya
and Motsuenayne Commissions in 1993, where he publicly admitted that he
had to take responsibility for allowing certain abuses to continue. To
continue punishing these officials endlessly would be contrary to humane
practice, and to the ANC's belief that after rehabilitation those members
who had erred should be reintegrated fully into structures. In addition,
these officials had not acted with personal vindictiveness; they had
acted within the broader context of weaknesses and problems afflicting
the ANC as a whole, as outlined in this section of our submission.

As the architect of the policy of reconciliation and nation-building, it
is the view of the ANC that all those who have made mistakes in the past
are capable of mending their ways and contributing to the building of a
new society.

We wish to bring it to the attention of the Commission that there are a
number of former agents and champions of the apartheid regime who now
occupy senior positions in public and private institutions. To hound
loyal anti-apartheid fighters who made mistakes in the course of struggle
would be to perpetrate a gross injustice.

3.5.2. The TRC has asked a number of questions concerning action taken
against members of the Security Department of NAT who were or who have
been accused of being guilty of ill-treating pris- oners and suspects. 

The names of those members of the Department who were imprisoned for
offences by host governments have also been requested. The TRC has also
asked for the list of NAT personnel which was submitted to the President
by the Skweyiya Commissioners. The full names of all NAT officials
mentioned in the Motsuenyane Commission have been requested by the TRC
"for research and investigative purposes."

Our answer to these questions is informed by the approach above. Those
who have already been severely punished not only by the ANC or the
authorities of host countries should not continue to be punished
endlessly.

The list of names produced by the Skweyiya Commission was based on a
fundamentally flawed process. Some members of NAT were falsely accused of
abuses by people who testified to the Skweyiya Commission. This
Commission did not even give those accused the right of reply, let alone
properly examine the allegations made by witnesses. This is precisely why
the Motsuenyane Commission was appointed.. The Motsuenyane Commission
followed a far more rigorous process of inquiry, and drew conclusions
regarding the behaviour of certain members of the Security sector of NAT.

Certain members of the former Security department will be approaching the
TRC with amnesty applications. If in the course of the investigations of
the TRC, more information is needed regarding any specific incident, the
ANC will provide appropria te assistance to the TRC.

3.5.3. The TRC has requested the "full evidence" on the basis of which
the Stuart, Skweyiya, Motsuen- yane and Thami Zulu inquiries came to
their conclusions, as well as all evidence presented to any other
commission of inquiry set up by the ANC. 

The ANC has already supplied the TRC with transcripts of the Motsuenyane
Commission hearings, but does not have access to all the other items of
evidence requested. We regret that we have not been able to locate all
the evidence placed before the 1984 Stuart Commission. All available
information connected with the Thami Zulu inquiry has been submitted to
the TRC.

The only other commission of inquiry into incidents of relevance to the
mandate of the TRC was a commission appointed to investigate the
circumstances under which three prisoners had died in Camp 32 in 1987/8,
and to generally review conditions. It was found that two had died of
natural causes but one had been beaten so badly that he died of his
injuries. A copy of this report has been submitted to the TRC.

3.5.4. The TRC has asked several ques- tions regarding the procedures of
all tribunals, military or other- wise, held in the past. All rele- vant
documentation has been requested. 

We trust that most of the questions asked by the TRC in this regard have
been answered adequately in this section. We regret that we have not been
able to locate all the documentation requested by the TRC. If further
questions arise regarding the procedures of specific tribunals, the ANC
will make every effort to assist the TRC by ensuring (as far as this is
possible) that those who served on tribunals will give oral evidence to
the TRC.

3.5.5. More information has been requested to support our "allega- tion"
that the Douglas "Com- mission of Inquiry" and the Returned Exiles
Coordinating Committee (Recoc) were state- sponsored campaigns to
discred- it the ANC. 

We believe we have already given the TRC all the information necessary to
allow a thorough investigation of the activities of Recoc, the front
called the International Freedom Foundation, and the Douglas "commission"
by going directly to those responsible for running these stratkom
operations.

These include the Strategic Communications committee of the SSC; Adriaan
Vlok, Johan van der Merwe, Lt-Col. Alf Oosthuizen of the former SAP (who
appears to have been the main co- ordinator of this stratkom operation
among others), and whoever else was tasked with stratkom operations
within the former SAP; Paul Erasmus (who has, as we pointed out, given
official documentation on the Recoc operation to the press); the former
head of Military Intelligence, "Joffel" van der Westhuizen, and the
former head of DMI's Communications Operations (renamed Command
Communications), Brig. Ferdi van Wyk; Russel Crystal, who has been
involved in stratkom operations since the 1980s and who fronted for the
IFF; evidence gathered by the Skweyiya Commission into corruption in the
former Bophutatswana, which found that Advocate Douglas had been paid
with taxpayers' money secretly routed through the Bophutatswana "national
security council."

There is also the agent who fronted for the SAP's Recoc, Patrick
Dlongwana (who later called himself Hlongwane.) Dlongwana has yet to
explain why he publicly claimed that the "armed wing" of his organisation
(the "South African Republican Army") was responsible for the murder of
ANC Midlands leader Reggie Hadebe, and a massacre in Daveyton in which
nine civilians were killed.

In this regard, it is clear that the Recoc stratkom went well beyond
merely discrediting the ANC, and was used as a smokescreen for certain
so-called "third force" violence.

Advocate Douglas himself, who is currently representing illegal gambling
houses in KwaZulu Natal, could also possibly assist.

3.5.6. The TRC has asked for the names of those who we described as
having been "wrongfully arrest- ed" in the wake of the discovery of the
spy network in 1981, and in what form apologies were ten- dered to them. 

With regard to the TRC's questions concerning those who were "wrongfully
arrested" in the wake of the discovery of the spy network in 1981, we
would like to make the following points: firstly, the term "wrongfully
arrested", as used in our main submission, means that people were
arrested because there were grounds for suspicion that they may have been
involved in the network, and were released when it was found that
insufficient evidence existed to confirm this suspicion. They were not
arrested for malicious reasons.

Secondly, we feel that listing the names of these people would be a
serious invasion of their privacy, which could result in unjustified
suspicions arising against them in their communities. Apologies were
tendered to these people in different ways; there was no standard form of
redress. Some received personal, verbal apologies from senior leadership
figures such as Joe Modise and/or Joe Nhlanhla. In some cases people were
provided with bursaries to further their studies. In other cases, they
wer e assisted with reintegration into various ANC structures.

3.5.7. The TRC has asked why the ANC did not establish a Commission to
investigate all the deaths of exiles (including "killings, extra- legal
executions, and disappear- ances")? 

We reiterate that no "extra-legal executions" were carried out in areas
where the ANC leadership had control over its structures and membership.
We have shown earlier that the ANC leadership acted in accordance with
our Code of Conduct and procedures which were refined over time.
Executions were only carried out after the cases had been considered by a
tribunal or other structure composed of senior leadership.

In fact the ANC did set up a structure to gather information on all
deaths in exile: the Bereaved Parents Committee, which is continuing its
work; and the list submitted to the TRC with our first submission is the
product of their labours.

3.5.8. TheTRC's requested more infor mation on attempts to exchange
prisoners 

The apartheid regime was not interested in attempting to free its agents,
presumably because they felt this would mean acknowledging that our
imprisoned cadres were prisoners of war. They cared very little for those
who had served them.

4 VIOLENCE BETWEEN 1990 - 1994 

The TRC has asked these questions with regard to what they call "ongoing
conflict" in the post-1990 phase: "It is clearly stated (in the ANC's
submission) that the violence was largely due to Third Force activity.
While this may be true, indications are that ANC members and cadres were
involved in the ongoing conflict. What level of responsibility should the
ANC leadership take for these actions?" 

They have also asked whether there is "any record of MK's role in SDU's
and instances where their actions may have resulted in gross human rights
violations - even where actions were understood to be in self-defence?
Can the ANC supply detail about the training, instruction and report-back
structures of the SDU's?" In a closely related question they ask "what
role did MK play in the SDUs in KwaZulu Natal, specifically in operations
against the IFP and KZP members after February 1990? Is there a record of
such MK actions?" The TRC wants a "more detailed account of MK activities
in the Transkei in the early 1990s". They want our response to "claims
that MK - especially operating from the Transkei - was responsible for
the killing or assassination of IFP office bearers, especially in the
early 1990s." 

The nature of violence, post-1990 

The TRC has commented that our first submission "showed limited focus on
the 1990 - 1994 conflict. It is clearly stated that violence was largely
due to Third Force activity. While this may be true, indications are that
ANC members and cadres were involved in the ongoing conflict. What level
of responsibility should the ANC leadership take for these actions?"

We feel that certain misconceptions which may have arisen should be
addressed. Firstly, our first submission did not show "limited focus" on
the period in question. A careful reading of our document will show that
considerable care was taken to highli ght the "anatomy" of state
repression in the 1980s, in describing the concept of
counter-mobilisation which underpinned the thinking of the security
establishment, in identifying critically important covert projects
(Ancor, Marion, etc.), and in as precisely as possible, indicating the
key structures tasked with work of this nature, rather than producing
endless examples of the tactical expression of these strategies.

The section on the post-1990 violence should be read as a continuation of
the earlier section on the 1980s. We concentrated on identifying key
features of this period, such as the continued existence of the National
Security Management System, renamed the National Co- ordinating Mechanism
(NCM), the continued existence of covert fronts and projects carried over
from the 1980s in some cases, and what we know of the activities of key
units such as the Directorate: Covert Collection, rather than giving many
examples of the thousands of acts of brutality which characterised this
bloodiest period of South Africa's history, in which around 12000
civilians were killed. We stated unambiguously that we believe the
violence was in essence a continuation of the violence of the 1980s, and
exhibited many of the features of the violence during that earlier period
as described above in this submission, although it was now projected as
"political intolerance" - or the work of a mysterious "third force" which
was supposedly against both the state and the ANC, intent on derailing
negotiations.

According to a recent report, official documents show that the State
Security Council first mooted the idea of a "third force" on 04/11/85.
Cabinet minutes of a meeting held in May 1986, which was chaired by PW
Botha, and at which FW de Klerk was present, show that the creation of
this "third force" was discussed again. It would be complementary to the
existing security forces, it was decided, "so that they will not be
unnecessarily compromised". It is difficult not to conclude that illegal,
covertly-managed violence was being contemplated, for which a specialised
unit would possibly be required. In other words, those engaged in
developing plans for this covert force were fully aware that they were
going to break their own laws, and were attempting to make provision for
the principle of "plausible denial" on the part of both the political
leadership and the upper echelons of the security establishment.

According to SSC and Cabinet minutes, final approval was given for the
setting up of an operations centre from which the "third force" would be
commanded on 22/09/86. But the model for this "third force" - which had
been developed by Niel Barnard, Adriaan Vlok, General Johan Coetzee, and
General Jannie Geldenhuys - was not implemented. According to these
minutes, the Cabinet was informed that structures were already in place
to carry out the tasks envisaged for the "third force". These included
the CCB, Unit C10 of the SB, and the Directorate: Covert Collection of
the Department of Military Intelligence.

In addition to these structures, we urge the TRC to investigate the role
of the Internal Stability Division (the re-named Riot Unit) since the
1980s, and the Reconnaissance Regiments, particularly 5 Recce, which has
been involved in providing support to Renamo for many years and which
was, according to former member Felix Ndimene, involved in some of the
train massacres in the post-1990 phase.

We again urge the TRC to thoroughly investigate the activities of key NCM
committees including the Cabinet Committee for Security Affairs, the
Security Secretariat (with its various sub-committees, particularly the
one tasked with Strategic Communications), the Security Committee (which
replaced the National Joint Management Centre), and the Joint Security
Staff. (More detail in this regard appears in our first submission on pp.
43-45.)

The former NIS, headed by Niel Barnard until early 1992, was a critically
important role-player at the highest strategic level, and we urge the TRC
to call on Mr Barnard to provide more information in this regard.

If we understand the term "third force" in this sense, the ANC would
agree with the TRC's interpretation of our submission to the effect that
most of the post-1990 violence was "third force" violence. As the
official manual of the National Co-ordinating Mechanism puts it, "the
application of the full powers of the state in order to resist the
revolutionary onslaught is still valid." The post-1990 violence was the
work of the state, was organised at the highest level, and was aimed at
strengthening the hand of the government at the negotiations table by
forcing a progressively weakened ANC into a reactive position in which it
would be held hostage to the violence, and forced to make constitutional
concessions.

In this regard, the cynical use of Inkatha in particular remained
critically important. Operation Marion was not terminated when De Klerk
came to power. According to a document dated 12/03/1990, written by
General Jannie Geldenhuys, it is stated that the State President had been
briefed on "a range of sensitive projects" and had given "approval in
principle for the running of Stratkom projects." According to this memo,
"covert Stratkom projects are controlled and managed by the secretary of
the State Security Council. This includes the allocation of areas of work
to departments. The secretary of the State Security Council receives
directives and assignments in this regard from the State President and
conveys this to the relevant department. The Stratkom projects in the
attached appendices are managed in consultation with, and on the request
of, the secretary of the SSC." Operation Marion is listed among the
"covert Stratkom projects" in the appendix attached to this memo.

The key question which must at all times be kept in mind is this: who
stood to benefit from the violence?

The ANC was not engaging in "ongoing conflict", nor were the majority of
people on the ground embroiled in "ongoing conflict": they were being
attacked by covert units operating in accordance with the wishes of the
apartheid regime, and by organised, armed "vigilantes" which had, with
the assistance of the NP's intelligence and security forces, established
informal military bases in several hostels from which to launch attacks
on civilians in their homes, on trains, or at bars and vigils. This was
fully in line with the original objectives of Project Marion, and the
determination of the De Klerk administration to maintain control over the
pace and content of the negotiations process.

Further information with regard to the use of Low-Intensity Warfare
tactics of this nature - which has not by any means been unique to South
Africa - is provided in an article, from the publication Challenge
accompanying our submission (appendix 8.)

We again urge the TRC to investigate those covert operations and key
structures we identified in our first submission, which we are confident
will expose the true nature of the post-1990 violence, and assist in
eradicating clandestine structures still in place to this day. As far as
possible, covert units or fronts were self-financing; some raised funds
through illegal activities such as vehicle theft, the smuggling of ivory
and rhino horn, and drug dealing.

SDUs in the context of post-1990 state-sponsored violence 

With regard to SDUs, we dealt with this question in considerable detail
in our first submission (please refer to pp. 63 - 66.) SDUs were formed
in response to state-sponsored violence which was devastating many
communities, with certain SAP units directly involved in these attacks by
omission or commission.

As the violence which exploded on the Reef in July 1990 intensified,
there were repeated calls by communities under attack for MK units to be
deployed to defend them. The ANC (and MK Military HQ) felt that the
negotiations could be jeopardised should MK become formally involved in
attempts to defend people from these attacks, but approved the
involvement of MK members based in communities under threat. in SDU
structures.

The ANC also set up a Peace Desk, which included representatives from
COSATU, the SACP, Sanco, and other community organisations. The Peace
Desk gathered information on the violence and participated in structures
set up in terms of the National Peace Accord. The ANC also took the issue
of violence to the negotiations table, and called on the De Klerk regime
to take action to halt the carnage. We took the issue to the United
Nations. Despite these efforts, the violence continued to intensify.

SDUs were established in communities under attack as a joint project
between the ANC and the community concerned. It should also be noted that
the legitimacy of SDU structures was recognised in terms of the National
Peace Accord.

As we stated in our first submission, some members of MK Military HQ were
tasked to attend to issues relating to the SDUs, their organisation,
training and the provision of weaponry. The draft document "For the Sake
of Our Lives" clearly states that allowing units of this nature to
operate with party-political bias would be highly dangerous and should be
avoided at all times. A full copy of this document, as requested by the
TRC, accompanies this submission (

APPENDIX ONE



ANC STRUCTURES AND PERSONNEL, 1960 - 1994


Please note: In this document we have concentrated mainly on those
structures which are of direct relevance to the mandate of the TRC. There
has been no attempt to cover our diplomatic structures, or departments
which fell under the offices of the Secretary-General or the
Treasurer-General over the years.

Most of the information contained in this appendix is drawn from
memories. There may be minor mistakes and omissions.

1. ANC STRUCTURES AND PERSONNEL: PRE - MOROGORO (1969) 

Following the banning of the ANC in 1960, OR Tambo was sent out of the
country to represent the ANC abroad; Yusuf Dadoo was deployed to
represent the SACP. After the arrests of most members of MK's National
High Command, some of those who had evaded arrest left the country.
Internal ANC (and SACP) leadership ceased to exist.

Under the leadership of OR Tambo, offices were established in
Dar-es-Salaam in 1964 to organise training of MK cadres. From 1964
onwards an office was established in Lusaka; by 1965 the ANC's HQ was in
Morogoro, Tanzania, and its main military camp was at Kongwa.

In 1966 the leadership group moved to Morogoro, which became ANC HQ, with
MK becoming the ANC's military wing. In 1967, OR Tambo became Acting
President, after the death of Chief Albert Luthuli. The ANC's
Secretary-General was Duma Nokwe, Moses Kotane filled the post of
Treasurer, and Joe Modise commanded MK. The primary task before them was
the reorganisation of the ANC's severely disrupted structures.

struggle.

The NEC was reduced to eight members after the Morogoro Conference, and
during the period between 1969 - 1985, the NEC and RC (later the PMC)
co-opted additional members as seen fit by the leadership.

5. ANC STRUCTURES 1983 - 1985 

The Senior Organs in the forward areas had not been particularly
effective in improving co-ordination between the political and military
aspects of struggle. In April 1983 a conference of all Front commanders
and commissars was held in Luanda to address the continuing problem of a
lack of effective co-ordination between the military and political
aspects of struggle. It was felt there should be joint planning, command
and control in all operations; and the ANC had to move towards building
military structures inside the country, taking a longer-term view and
preparing the ground for peoples' war in order to sustain military
operations, rather than carrying out a string of one-off "pot boiling"
actions.

The NEC resolved to intensify its work both inside and outside the
country. External work was to be co-ordinated by a newly-created External
Coordinating Committee.

The Revolutionary Council was replaced by the Politico-Military Council
(PMC), which became the executive arm of the NEC in relation to all
matters pertaining to the conduct of the political and military struggle
inside South Africa. The PMC co-ordinated the activities of the Political
HQ, Military HQ, and NAT, and was supported in its activities by a small
Secretariat. By 1983 a new Military Headquarters (MHQ) had been
established, bringing together and reorganising the old general HQ along
formal military lines.

The PMC met once a month and was tasked with the overall strategic
planning for internal ANC/MK work, and to assess the state of the nation.
The executive committee of the PMC, the Secretariat, met between full PMC
meetings on a weekly basis.

The Senior Organs were replaced by Regional Politico-Military Committees
(RPMCs), and were also given the authority and responsibility for making
operational decisions. The RPMCs were charged with co-ordinating
political and military activities in their areas of responsibility, and
(where possible) setting up Area PMCs inside the country. Area PMCs would
be responsible for providing local-level leadership on political and
military matters, the gathering of intelligence, and the screening of
recruits.

increase in mass struggle inside the country, Political HQ was replaced
with a strengthened Internal Political Committee (IPC) in 1987.

Operation Vula was launched in 1986, with Joe Slovo assisting the
President. Mac Maharaj and Ronnie Kasrils were among the leading figures
in this project. By 1988, Mac Maharaj and Siphiwe Nyanda had been
infiltrated into the country.

Discipline, three offices were established specifically to better
regulate disciplinary procedures, and halt abuses that had been
occurring. These were the Review Board, the Officer of Justice, and the
National Peoples' Tribunal.

A Provisional Directorate of Intelligence and Security was created to run
NAT, and action was taken to clarify the command structures over NAT
personnel deployed in Angola. A President's Council (also referred to as

APPENDIX TWO MK CAMPS AND COMMANDERS


During the period from 1976 - 1980, camps in Angola fell under the
command of the late Mzwandile Piliso, at the time head of the department
of Military Training and Personnel. In 1980, Simon Shekeshe ("Julius
Mokoena") was appointed Regional Commander. He was succeeded by Graham
Morodi ("Mashego") in 1982. Godfrey Ngwenya

("Timothy Mokoena") was the next Regional Commander until 1985 when he
was injured in a UNITA ambush, and then Ali Makhosini took over this
post. The following MK camps were maintained by the ANC in Angola; all
camps were closed down in 1989, when military structures were shifted to
Uganda and Tanzania.

Gabela Training Camp 

This was the first training camp to be opened in Angola by the ANC, in
1976. It catered for the first group of 40 MK cadres to receive military
training in Angola, and was under the command of FAPLA and Cuban
instructors. Gabela Training Camp was merged with Benguela Camp in 1977.

Engineering Luanda (Transit Camp) 

This camp opened in late 1976 and was closed in mid-1977. It catered for
only two intakes of cadres who were in transit to training camps. The
average number of cadres present was 200.

Commander: Simon Shekeshe, then "Castro" Ramokgopa

Benguela Transit Camp 

This transit camp was established in mid 1977 for cadres who had been at
Engineering Camp and Gabela camp, and who were on their way to open Nova
Catengue Training Camp. The numerical strength was around 300 cadres. The
camp was closed in 1982.

Commanders: Simon Shekeshe, followed by "Dlokolo."

Nova Catengue Training Camp 

Established in 1976, this camp accommodated around 500 cadres from the
transit camps listed above. The camp was destroyed in an aerial
bombardment in 1979, based on intelligence supplied to the apartheid
regime by infiltrators within MK.

Commander: Simon Shekeshe.

Quibaxe Training Camp 

Originally a transit camp established in September 1977, it became a
training camp in 19.. It accommodated around 200 cadres. The camp closed
in 1989.

Commanders: Successively, Parker Tsie (1977 - 1980), Oupa G. Banda,
Seremane Kgositsile ("Kenneth Mahamba"), Livingstone Tom Gaza, Herbert
Malinga, and Lloyd Mabizela, Sydney Mpila.

Funda Training Camp 

Established in 1976, this camp usually had fewer than 100 cadres present
at any time. It was closed in 1988. This camp provided specialised
training.

Commanders: Zakes Tolo, then Seeiso Morapedi.

Fazenda Military Camp 

Fazenda camp was established in 1978. It catered for trained cadres who
were undergoing further training courses, including "survival" training.
The numerical strength was around 200 cadres at any time. It was closed
in 1980 or early 1981 when it was merged with Quibaxe camp.

Commander: Livingstone Tom Gaza

Pango Camp 

Founded in 1979 after the destruction of Nova Catengue in April that
year. The numerical strength was around 400 cadres at any time. It closed
in 1989.

Commanders: Successively, Thami Zulu (1979 - 1981), Seremane Kgositsile,
Godfrey Ngwenya, Matthews Nkosi, Phillip Sebothoma, Dumile Thabekhulu,
Ben Senokoanyane.

Viana Transit Camp (also known as Camp 001) 

Established in 1979, this camp catered for newly recruited members of MK
on their way to other camps for military training. The average strength
of the camp was around 400 cadres. It closed in 1989.

Commanders: Sucessively, Dan Hatto, Golden Rahube, Steven Kobe, Johnson
Langa, Lawrence Madi, Leepo Modise.

Hoji Ya Henda (also known as Camalundi) 

Founded in 1980, the camp was short-lived and was closed in January 1981,
when it was shifted to Caculama and became known as Caculama Camp or
Malanje. It catered for around 300 - 400 cadres at any time.

Commanders: Mzwakhe Ngwenya, then Godfrey N. Ngwenya

Caculama (Malanje) 

Established in January 1981, as described above. Around 400 cadres were
accommodated at this camp. It was closed in 1989.

Commanders: Successively, Godfrey N. Ngwenya, Sipho Binda, Thibe Lesole,
Dumisane Mafo, Themba Nkabinde, Steven Kobe.

Caxito Training Camp 

This camp replaced Funda camp in 1979. The number of cadres varied from
time to time but seldom more than 100 were present. Caxito was in a
malaria infested area and was for this reason closed down in 1984.

Commanders: Successively, Andile Ndzanga, Robert Mandita, Dumile
Thabekhulu, and Ben Senokoanyane.

===========================================================================



APPENDIX THREE



REHABILITATION AND DETENTION CENTRES


1. The Morris Seabelo Rehabilitation Centre 

(also known as Camp 32 or Quatro) 

This facility was opened in 1979 and closed down in 1989, when inmates
were moved to a government facility in Uganda.

The commanders of Camp 32 were successively: Sizwe Mkhonto, Morris
Seabelo, Afrika Nkwe (for a few months only), Mzwandile Damoyi and
William Masango.

Note: more information on Camp 32 appears in the NAT Operations report. 

2. The RC, Lusaka 

Initially this building was used by Military HQ, and MK cadres who had
been found guilty of disciplinary offences would be confined here for
limited periods as punishment - a kind of "detention barracks." Later, it
was used to hold discovered agents or definite suspects in transit to
Camp 32. It was closed in 1987 when Sun City was opened to take its
place. Conditions at the RC were good, and very few people were held here
at any time; it is not possible to give an estimate, as requested by the
TRC, for the number of inmates at the RC at any one time. The RC did not
have a commander as such; those responsible for people held at the RC
would be senior MK and NAT officials in the region.

3. Sun City, Lusaka 

Sun City was opened in 1988 and closed in 1991. It was not like Camp 32,
with a command structure - it was largely a holding facility, as
described above. There were one or two guards, and Jan Mampane ("Reddy
Mazimba") of the Regional NAT Directorate was responsible for people held
at Sun City. Most of those held were definite suspects who had been
isolated for purposes of investigation, and some who could not be held at
Camp 32 because it was so badly overcrowded.

4. Various holding facilities and the rehabilitation centre known as "The
Farm" in Tanzania. 

A brief description of the ANC's facilities in Morogoro and Dakawa is
necessary to clear up confusion which may have arisen. The Solomon
Mahlangu Freedom College was built in Morogoro in the late 1970s. There
was a primary school, high school, day care centre and also an adult
education centre, with staff houses and other facilities. Unit 1 was part
of the dormitory and kitchen area, and a small office was used here to
briefly confine people who had committed serious breaches of discipline
before they were sent to Lusaka for their cases to be considered. It was
not a prison in any sense of the word.

The Tanzanian government also had an office and representative at the
entrance to the complex, where there was a temporary holding facility
since there was no police station in the immediate area. People who had
broken the laws of the land would at times be held here by the Tanzanian
government before being taken to the nearest police station, after which
the law would take its normal course. This too was not in any sense a
prison.

The Farm was established in late 1987 as a rehabilitation centre for ANC
members based in the area who had committed offences in terms of the
ANC's code of conduct, but whose cases the Tanzanian government
considered too petty to be dealt with in their courts of law (for
example, stealing and selling clothing.) It was also at times used as a
holding facility for confessed agents and definite suspects whilst the
security structures in Tanzania were waiting for tickets to arrive from
Lusaka so that these agents or definite suspects could be flown out of
the area. Conditions were not harsh; the centre consisted of proper
buildings with tiled rooves; there was running water and flush toilets.

In 1989, when all camps were closed down in Angola, a batch of six
dangerous agents who had in fact been sentenced to death by tribunal, but
who had not been executed, arrived in Tanzania. The local NAT structures
had no information as to why these agents had arrived in Tanzania and
were alarmed at their appearance in this civilian area; they temporarily
confined these agents at the Farm whilst seeking clarity from structures
in Lusaka. The Tanzanian government assisted by clearing a wing of a
local prison to confine these agents. Conditions in the prison were not
harsh.

The regional NAT structures responsibile for these holding facilities and
the rehabilitation centre during the 1980s were headed successively by
Daniel Oliphant ("Mtu Jwili"), Gabriel Mthembu ("Sizwe Mkhonto"), and
David Motshweni ("Willy Williams").

5. The Ugandan prison 

By the time Camp 32 was closed down, there was a total of 69 prisoners.
After negotiations with the Ugandan government, they were transferred to
a small prison in the town of Kayunga, where conditions were considerably
better. The number of prisoners was further reduced by releases until
only 32 of the most hardened agents remained; these too were released in
1991.

The head of NAT structures in the region was Wandile Dlamini; Lister Mooi
along with Ugandan prison officials were responsible for guarding the
prisoners.

Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) operations report


1. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE  "The time comes in the life of
any nation when there remain only two choices: submit or fight. That time
has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice
but to hit back by all means within our power in defence of our people,
our future, and our freedom". The objective of the armed struggle was the
overthrow of the apartheid state in order to achieve democracy, freedom
and peace in South Africa. The ANCs decision to embark on armed struggle
was reached after many decades of non-violent resistance, which was met
by increasingly brutal repression by the apartheid regime.

The African National Congress (ANC) had no choice but to resort to armed
struggle after the National Party government first narrowed the arena of
legal political activity and finally closed it in 1960 by banning the
movement. The ANC asserted moral legitimacy for the resort to violence on
the grounds of necessary defence and just war. Further, Umkhonto we Sizwe
was a means to channel the revolutionary violence the oppressed were
calling for, especially after the Sharpeville massacre:
Some (spontaneous actions of the people) result from Government
provocation, the peoples patience becomes exhausted, and the masses
become desperate in the absence of a strong militant organisation. In
these circumstances people are likely to resort more and more into
senseless dangerous forms of action. If we embark on unplanned and
misguided political actions, we are playing into the hands of the enemy.
(ANC National Executive Committee statement, 1963.)
From the very beginning, the ANC emphasised that armed resistance took
place within political context, and was one of a number of inter-related
methods of struggle. Cadres had to fully understand the basic policy
positions of the ANC, the first step in military training; they were at
all times guided by and subordinate to the political leadership of the
ANC.

Cadres were taught to maintain the moral high ground occupied by the
liberation movement, owing to the justness of our cause, in the actual
theatre of battle. This meant that the choice of targets, attitude
towards civilians and treatment of captives had to reflect the ANCs
policies. The forms of armed struggle adopted by the ANC and MK were
intended to achieve the goals of the movement with the least loss of
life: in essence, the armed struggle was waged to bring peace to South
Africa - to stop the apartheid regime as quickly and as effectively as
possible in order to prevent the conflict in the country degenerating
into racial civil war.

2. THE POLITICO-MILITARY CHAIN OF COMMAND 

MK was at all times subordinate to the political leadership of the ANC.
Detailed information on ANC structures and personnel, including military
structures and personnel, is attached to the main document of this second
submission (appendix 1.)

3. MK TRAINING AND TRAINING CAMPS 

Few liberation movements have had to wage armed struggle under such
complex, difficult and harsh conditions. In the early years, South Africa
was surrounded by countries hostile to the idea of liberation,
particularly Rhodesia and the former Portuguese colonies. There were no
friendly bases on the borders of our country, which made infiltration
into South Africa difficult and dangerous. Cadres spent many lonely years
in the camps long after they had completed their training because of this
difficulty. At times there was a scarcity of food and clothing, a lack of
medicines and health facilities.

In this regard, the role of the Commissariat became crucial. In all the
camps, there was a commissariat responsible for the political education,
general welfare and cultural well-being of cadres.

Serious attention was given to the general education of cadres. Special
literacy classes and bridging courses were designed. So successful were
these courses that many who completed them were able to enroll in formal
education institutions in countries such as Angola, Zambia, Tanzania and
Uganda.

In a centre outside Luanda called Technical Training Centre (Moscow),
formal education was given in mechanics and auto electrics; driving
lessons were also available. The ANC also ran a huge centre called the
Self-Help Medical Centre (the Plot) where courses in nursing, advanced
motor mechanics, building and carpentry were offered. Hundreds of cadres
trained in these centres became professionals.

There were two centres in Angola (Quela and Camalundi) for training
cadres in agriculture and the production of food for the army. Production
was very successful, especially in the early 1980s. We were able to
supply most of the camps. Our camps were bee-hives of cultural
activities. There was a network of committees to promote music, drama,
literature, etc. In all camp programmes, cultural activity was
compulsory. Many excellent choirs, drama and musical groups were formed.
Many poets emerged from our camps, who continue to produce magnificent
work to this day. Perhaps the highest achievement in this regard was the
formation of the cultural ensemble known as Amandla Group. It was
supported and nurtured by great South African artists such as Jonas
Gwangwa, Dennis Dipale, Abdullah Ibrahim, Letta Mbuli, and others. The
group became internationally renowned, staging successful tours in
Southern Africa and Europe.

Military training courses were designed to produce a cadre with a broad
range of skills, well equipped to execute the various tasks of the
liberation struggle. Lectures were conducted on political science, and
the art of warfare.

The following military subjects were taught in the camps:
1.  Military topography
2.  Military Engineering
3.  Military Tactics
4.  Physical Training
5.  March and Drill
6.  Firearms
7.  Artillery
8.  Political Education
9.  First Aid
10.  Anti-Air Weaponry.
11.  Military Combat Work (ie. underground or clandestine methods of
    organisation, and methods of planning insurrection)
Courses ran for three weeks, three months, six months, nine months or
longer depending on the mission/tasks for which the individual or unit
was being prepared.

Over the years thousands of cadres were produced, among them commanders,
commissars, instructors and specialists in various military fields. Some
would remain to staff the camps and continue to train other cadres; many
infiltrated the country for various tasks; yet others joined the
diplomatic corps to run the many external missions of the liberation
movement.

Today many of these cadres are to be found among the leadership of the
Alliance; some are ambassadors and officials in foreign missions; others
are Ministers, members of Parliament, in the civil service and the
private sector. Others served many years of imprisonment, or gave their
lives for the liberation of this country.

A full list of MK training camps and the names of commanders, as
requested by the TRC, is attached to the main document of this second
submission as appendix 2.

4. MK OPERATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MAJOR PHASES OF THE LIBERATION
STRUGGLE 

4.1. The Sabotage Campaign to the Morogoro Conference 

The first MK actions in 1960 were sabotage operations; cadres were under
strict instructions to avoid all loss of life. Targets included
government installations, police stations, electric pylons, pass offices,
and other symbols of apartheid rule; in rural areas, there were arson
attacks on sugar cane fields and wattle estates.

The sabotage campaign failed in its objective of convincing the apartheid
regime to engage in negotiations in a National Convention. By the time of
the Rivonia arrests, MK leaders were discussing the possibility of
embarking on guerilla warfare to take the struggle forward.

The draft document Operation Mayibuye indicated aspects of the thinking
of the leadership at this time, and identified targets as follows:
1.  strategic road, railways and other communications.
2.  power stations
3.  police stations, camps and military forces
4.  irredeemable Government stooges.
In the years following the Rivonia arrests the ANC built up a force in
some of the liberated countries in Africa. It was decided to launch a
joint campaign (later known as the Wankie campaign) with ZIPRA in
Zimbabwe in 1967/8. This operation was aimed at infiltrating trained MK
operatives into South Africa in line with the concept of rural-based
guerilla warfare. However, some of the operatives were forced to move
into Botswana and others had to withdraw to Zambia after considerable
difficulties were encountered, particularly the lack of bases among the
population. A group of cadres, including Chris Hani, were captured in
Botswana and served prison sentences there.

Following the Wankie campaign, the ANC held a watershed Consultative
Conference at Morogoro in 1969 to discuss ways of taking the struggle
forward. Conference adopted a new programme, Strategy and Tactics of the
ANC. This was the first comprehensive set of strategic guidelines for the
ANC in the period of armed struggle.

A decision was made to shift the ANCs approach from sending armed groups
of cadres into the country to spark off guerilla warfare, and instead
emphasised that period of political reconstruction inside the country was
necessary since the successful development of armed struggle depended on
political mobilisation and strong underground structures, an important
precursor to theories of peoples war developed in the early 1980s.

Military struggle was seen as forming only part of, and being guided by,
a broader political strategy to ensure that the battle against apartheid
was fought on all possible fronts, involving not just an army but all
those oppressed by apartheid:

When we talk of revolutionary armed struggle, we are talking of political
struggle by means which include the use of military force (...) It is
important to emphasise this because our movement must reject all
manifestations of militarism which separates armed peoples struggle from
its political context.

4.2. 1969 - 1979: from Sabotage to Guerilla Warfare 

Guerilla warfare is carried out by a small and militarily weak
organisation - poorly armed but highly mobile - against a highly
organised conventional force which has all the resources of the state
behind it. From the outset MK aimed to limit the loss of civilian lives,
and constantly targeted the military and police, who formed the frontline
of defence of the apartheid state.

Classic guerilla warfare roots itself among the rural population and
moves from there into urban areas; it is dependent on the availability of
suitable terrain, such as inaccessible mountains or forests where base
camps can be established. In contrast, MKs tactics had to take into
account the relatively unfavourable terrain in South Africa. A
multi-faceted approach was adopted, with guerilla operations carried out
throughout the country in both rural and urban areas, targeting the
central pillars on which the apartheid state rested:
* Economic infrastructure: this entailed attacks on fuel supplies, the
  lifeblood of the economy; the power network without which no modern
  developed country can function and the strategic road, railways and
  communications network essential for trade.
* Military targets included the SADF and paramilitary police forces
* Political-state infrastructure, which included all government
  installations and personnel involved in the administration of the
  apartheid state.
This basic approach did not change over the years, even under extreme
provocation, However, by the early 1980s it was accepted that in the
context of intensified confrontation between the apartheid regime and
forces for democratic change, the fear of civilians being caught in the
cross-fire could no longer be a decisive factor in avoiding certain armed
operations directed against the personnel and infrastructure of the
apartheid state.

The Soweto Uprising 

The 1976 uprising, and subsequent massacres and other atrocities by the
security forces, gave new impetus to the struggle. Thousands of new
recruits flooded into MK, bringing with them a fresh will to fight the
enemy, born of their own bitter experience in fighting a brutal enemy
only with stones. New vistas opened to intensify the struggle and to hit
back in defence of the people.

The key challenge was to channel this youthful and impatient militancy
into military/political struggle within ANC policy guidelines. The ANC
had the responsibility to educate these youths to understand that the
enemy was in fact the system of apartheid itself, not white individuals.
It is a remarkable achievement on the part of the ANC that we succeeded
in doing this. Many of these youths, after initial training in MK camps
and in Eastern Europe, were briefed and infiltrated back into the country
to begin operations.

Between 1976 and 1979 there was a marked escalation of armed actions:
about 37 armed actions took place between June 1976 and the end of 1978.
Railway lines were sabotaged, police stations attacked, and Bantu
Administration offices were bombed. The battle was slowly but surely
being taken to the enemy, and MK had moved from concentrating purely on
sabotage operations to the first stages of guerilla war.

4.3. Guerilla warfare and Peoples War, 1979 - 1990 

As we stated in our main submission to the Truth Commission, the
watershed 1978 Politico-Military Commissions Report (also known as the
Green Book) again stressed the central importance of political
mobilisation: "The armed struggle must be based on, and grow out of, mass
political support and it must eventually involve all our people. All
military activities must at every stage be guided by and determined by
the need to generate political mobilisation, organisation and resistance,
with the aim of progressively weakening the enemys grip on his reins of
political, economic, social and military power, by a combination of
political and military action." In line with this approach, the
Revolutionary Council (formed in 1969 and chaired by OR Tambo) was
reorganised to reinforce the supremacy of political leadership. It was
also intended to ensure that the task of mass mobilisation and
underground organisation received the necessary emphasis - to reinforce
the links between the armed struggle the mass base and the underground
structures of the ANC.

A Central Operational MK HQ was established by Joe Modise and Joe Slovo.
After several years in which there had been no MK actions inside the
country, following the impetus of the Soweto uprising units were sent
into the country in 1978 to carry out attacks on police stations - this
has come to be known as the G5 Operation. It was commanded by Siphiwe
Nyanda; stations attacked included Moroka, Orlando and Booysens The
following year, in 1979, the President, OR Tambo, asked the NEC for a
mandate to form a special unit to attack key strategic targets -
spectacular operations that would hit the economy hard, and inspire the
oppressed majority. The unit would report directly to him; he would
authorise such attacks and take political responsibility for them. This
was agreed to, and the first Special Operations Command consisted of Joe
Slovo, Montso Mokgabudi (Obadi), and Aboobaker Ismail (Rashid.)

As with other MK units, targets were carefully selected in accordance
with the political policies of the movement, and planning for operations
was as careful as possible. Whenever possible, a final reconnaissance was
undertaken just before an attack to ensure that conditions had not
changed: this was to ensure we minimised the loss of civilian life. A
further aspect of all planning was to ensure that cadres had planned for
their safe withdrawal after attacks, and had the necessary resources to
do so.

Initially the targets were limited to oil refineries, fuel depots, the
Koeberg nuclear plant and military targets such as Voortrekkerhoogte.
With the increasingly indiscriminate attacks on neighbouring states and
the viciousness of attacks on South African civilians by the security
forces, it was decided by Special Operations Command to attack military
personnel. This resulted in operations such as the car bomb at South
African Air Force HQ in Pretoria.

The case studies presented will indicate that such operations were not
carried out on the spur of the moment or on the whim of a particular
individual, but were based on months of careful preparations.

Parallel to operations carried out by Special Operations, there was a
steady increase in the number of operations carried out by other MK units
from Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and, in later years, Zimbabwe. One
study estimated that 150 cases of armed action took place between 1976
and 1982, overwhelmingly concentrated on economic targets, the
administrative machinery of apartheid, SAP and SADF installations and
personnel.

In mid-1983 MHQ produced a discussion document Planning for Peoples War1
which posed the question as to whether the time was ripe to move away
from the 1979 approach towards peoples war, defined as war in which a
liberation army becomes rooted among the people who progressively
participate actively in the armed struggle both politically and
militarily, including the possibility of engaging in partial or general
uprising. Among the conclusions were that the ANC should continue
carrying out and even escalating those actions which had played an
important role in stimulating political activity, mass resistance and
mass organisation, but that there should be more concentration on
destroying enemy personnel. )The term enemy personnel referred primarily
to members of the SAP and SADF.) The concept of potential future
guerrilla zones inside the country was raised.

This document noted that the policy of arming the people cannot mean that
we begin now to distribute arms to whosoever wishes to receive them among
the oppressed. In the first place, we had neither the capacity nor the
means to do this on any meaningful scale. In the second place it would be
completely wrong to engage in a policy of merely distributing weaponry to
people, trusting to luck that they will use them on the side of the
revolution.

This document reflected the debates that were taking place all the time
in the ranks of the liberation movement on how to respond to new
situations as they emerged. The essence of these debates was around the
restraint of the ANC in the face of the enemy s brutality - whether we
should not adopt the easy route, and allow less discriminate control over
the usage of weapons and choice of targets. At each stage of struggle,
people on the ground would respond with anger to repression, and
themselves start to take initiatives which would not strictly accord with
the strategy and tactics of the ANC.

The constant challenge facing the ANC and MK was how to channel anger on
the ground to ensure that the strategic perspective of a democratic and
non-racial society is not sacrificed on the alter of quick-fix, dramatic
and misguided actions. The tension between such intensification of
struggle and the need to avoid a racial war that the MK Manifesto
eloquently expressed at the founding of the liberation army, remained
with the movement to the last day of armed struggle.

In contrast to this highly disciplined and restrained approach to the use
of violence, the South African regime committed atrocity after atrocity
against civilian targets inside and outside the country, including
supporting the war efforts of UNITA and Renamo, and massive raids against
what were portrayed as ANC targets in neighbouring states such as Matola
in 1991,1982 Maseru massacre, Gaborone in 1985, Lusaka in 1987, Harare
and Bulawayo, to quote a few examples. Several of the casualties in these
operations were nationals of the host countries. No distinction
whatsoever was made between hard and soft targets - between MK operatives
and unarmed refugees and civilians including women and children.

In an interview with OR Tambo published on 06/08/83 in The Guardian, the
issue of civilian casualties was dealt with:
"When we blew up the Sasol tanks, where thousands of people were working,
the attack was carried out in such a way that no-one was injured. Yet on
the other hand our people were being captured, tortured and mercilessly
interrogated. We have fought back when attacked, and there have been many
clashes with the police, but only the police. Lately the regime has
become almost desperate. There have been assassinations of our people. In
1979 they tried to kill hundreds of our people at a military school in
Angola."
Referring to the Matola raid, the Maseru raid and the SAAF bombing of
Maputo, OR Tambo added:
"This means the conflict is escalating. We always thought it was going to
be a bitter, brutal , vicious struggle, almost as a necessary
precondition for the liberation of South Africa. We have to go through
that. The conflict is reaching new levels. There is to be much
destruction, much suffering, and a lot of bloodshed which will not be
confined to South Africa. (...)

...In 1980 we signed the Geneva protocols and said that if we captured
any enemy soldiers we would treat them as prisoners of war. The fact is
we are not against civilians. We do not include them in our definition of
the enemy. The ANC was non-violent for a whole decade in the face of
violence against African civilians. What do we mean by civilians? It
really means white civilians. No one refers to Africans as civilians and
they have been victims of shootings all the time. Even children. They
have been killed in the hundreds. Yet the word has not been used in all
these years. Now it is being used, especially after the Pretoria
[SAAF/HQ] bomb. But implicit in the practice of the South African regime
is that when you shoot an African you are not killing a civilian. We don
t want to kill civilians. But some will be hit, quite accidentally and
regrettably. I am sure we are going to lose many civilians and many
innocent people, as happens in any violent situation. (...)

We do not boast about it in the way the SA regime boasts about its
killings...I think South Africa is going to be a very happy country one
day and we will avoid all avoidable loss of life but - harsh though this
sounds - we cannot allow the system to persist for the sake of saving a
few lives. It is not so harsh when one considers how many lives apartheid
has destroyed. "
4.3.1. 1985: The Kabwe Conference and controversies surrounding the issue
of soft targets 

The questions of ANC policy towards soft targets and taking the struggle
to white areas arise in the context of the unprecedented, mass-based
confrontation with the apartheid state which was taking place at all
levels of society within the country from the early 1980s onwards.
Civics, community organisations, and trade unions were all engaged in
intense struggles. MK operations increased sharply, most of them carried
out by formal units based inside the country, many of which were
supported and housed by underground political cells.

The Kabwe conference was held in June 1985 to assess developments since
the Morogoro conference of 1969. The day before it opened, Pretoria
attacked several homes in Gaborone, Botswana, killing 12 people - two
young female citizens of Botswana (who were blown to pieces), one
Somalian, a six-year old child from Lesotho, and eight South Africans,
five of whom were members of the ANC, but none of them members of MK. All
those killed were unarmed.

Conference reaffirmed ANC policy with regard to targets considered
legitimate: SADF and SAP personnel and installations, selected economic
installations and administrative infrastructure. But the risk of
civilians being caught in the crossfire when such operations took place
could no longer be allowed to prevent the urgently needed, all-round
intensification of the armed struggle. The focus of armed operations had
to shift towards striking directly at enemy personnel, and the struggle
had to move out of the townships to the white areas. This was immediately
seized on by the propaganda machinery of the apartheid regime, and
falsely portrayed as a decision to begin indiscriminate killings of white
civilians.

OR Tambo expressed the mood of the Conference eloquently. It represented,
he said,
"...a turning point in the history of all the people of South Africa. Our
Conference itself will be remembered by our people as a council-of-war
that planned the seizure of power by these masses, the penultimate
convention that gave the order for us to take our country through the
terrible but cleansing fires of revolutionary war to a condition of
peace, democracy and the fulfilment of our people who have already
suffered far too much and far too long."
At a press conference he noted that in the preceding nine to ten months
many soft targets had been hit by the enemy - nearly 500 civilians had
been killed. The distinction between hard and soft targets is going to
disappear in an intensified confrontation, in an escalating conflict.
(...) I am not saying that our Conference used the word soft targets. I
am saying that Conference recognised that we are in it. It is happening
every day, he said.

By the end of 1985 an official pamphlet titled "Take the Struggle to the
White Areas!" was distributed inside the country.

Targets were identified as follows: the racist army, police, death
squads, agents and stooges in our midst, and the call to take the war to
the white areas is defined as follows:
* "Strengthening our workers organisations and engaging in united
  action in the factories, mines, farms and suburbs
* Spreading the consumer boycott to all areas of the country
* Organised and well-planned demonstrations in the white suburbs and
  central business districts.
* Forming underground units and combat groups in our places of work and
  taking such actions as sabotage in the factories, mines, farms and
  suburbs, and disrupt the enemys oil, energy, transport, communications
  and other vital systems
* Systematic attacks against the army and police and the so-called area
  defence units in the white areas.
* Well-planned raids on the armouries and dumps of the army, police,
  farmers and so on to secure arms for our units."
The ANC leadership had called on all members and supporters of the ANC to
intensify the struggle at all costs, to move towards creating a situation
of ungovernability and peoples war.

There were long and insecure lines of communication, command and control.
Many of the established MK units had been allowed a degree of initiative
in executing their operations, as long as these remained within policy
guidelines.

In contrast with a conventional military force, in which planning takes
place at HQ level by experienced officers, in guerilla warfare most of
the detailed planning takes place at the lowest level: each cadre has to
be trusted to make principled and educated decisions with regard to
choice of target, whilst keeping a close eye on developments and feelings
among the people in his/her community - a responsibility which no soldier
in a conventional force ever has to face. There was no hotline to higher
structures to ask for guidance; communication could - and at times did -
result in deaths, given the degree to which communication lines were
monitored. Consequently, a great deal depended on the political maturity,
general experience, and immediate situation in which each cadre operated.

Maintaining discipline in guerilla and conventional armed forces is also
fundamentally different. In the case of a guerilla force, discipline
flows from a thorough understanding of the political objectives of the
armed struggle - not from threats of court-martial or punishment.

MK cadres conducted crash courses for eager volunteers inside the
country. Some of these recruits had sketchy political understanding of
the nature of the struggle in comparison with those cadres who had gone
through the intensive political and military training offered in camps in
exile. Some supporters drifted in and out of structures, were never
thoroughly under the discipline of the ANC and MK, yet commanders on the
ground sometimes found their contributions indispensable.

Cadres made decisions in the context of pressures they encountered on a
day-to-day basis, in which enemy atrocities against civilians were
mounting. Increasing numbers of attacks took place in urban areas, and
civilians were increasingly caught in the crossfire. Bona fide cadres and
supporters who carried out attacks of this nature believed they were
fulfilling the general direction to carry the struggle to the white areas
in accordance with the political will of the leadership of the ANC.

The period between 1985 and 1988 witnessed unprecedented violence,
overwhelmingly directed at black civilians, as the regime fought to
regain the strategic initiative it had lost.

Increasingly in this period, attacks took place in urban areas, in which
civilians were caught in the crossfire. Bona fide cadres and supporters
who carried out attacks of this nature believed they were fulfilling the
general direction to intensify the struggle and carry it into the white
areas in accordance with the political will of the leadership of the ANC.

This behaviour of the regime was a significant factor in provoking
certain attacks which were in breach of policy. Anger on the ground was
explosive: the atrocities committed by the apartheid regime demanded
retaliation, and the careful response was at times met with angry
contempt. In some cases, cadres responded to state brutality by hitting
back in anger, as soon as possible - as in the case of the Amanzimtoti
bomb, described in detail in our main submission. A comment by OR Tambo
in response to this attack is worth repeating: "Massacres have been
perpetrated against civilians: Mamelodi, a massacre. Uitenhage, a
massacre. Botswana, a massacre. Queenstown, a massacre...certainly, we
are beginning to see South Africans of all races (burying) their loved
ones who have died in the South African situation. The whole of South
Africa is beginning to bleed...If I had been approached by an ANC unit
and asked whether they should go and plant a bomb at a supermarket I
would have said, Of course not . But when our units are faced with what
is happening all around them, it is understandable that some of the
should say, Well, I may have to face being disciplined, but I am going to
do this." A factor which should not be underestimated is that the banning
by the regime of all ANC literature and jamming of broadcasts from Radio
Freedom made it extremely difficult for senior ANC leadership to get
through to cadres and activists on the ground to ensure a proper
understanding of policy. Every effort was made to block and distort the
ANCs message, or anything which could be remotely construed as supportive
of the message of the liberation movement. An extraordinary range of
items were banned; possession of ANC publications such as a pamphlet or a
copy of Mayibuye or Sechaba could result in a lengthy jail sentence.

Given the circumstances at the time, it is remarkable that so few armed
attacks took place in which there was a high rate of civilian casualties.
MK acted with great restraint; we certainly had the capacity to kill many
thousands of civilians - it would have been easy to do this - but the ANC
leadership never took this route, even under extreme provocation. The
humanity of this approach has never been acknowledged - nor reciprocated
- by the apartheid regime, which always saw black civilians in general
(and all those who opposed the regime) as forming an integral part of
enemy forces, whether they were armed or not.

Operational and technical difficulties leading to unintended consequences 

When unexpected difficulties arose, cadres had to think on their feet:
and sometimes they made the wrong decisions. At times, given the refusal
of the regime to treat MK members as prisoners of war, the situations
they faced were desperate to the extent that it is highly unlikely that
there would be a peaceful outcome, no matter what they decided - the
Silverton bank siege and the Goch Street incident are cases in point.

Gathering reliable information and tactical intelligence was often
exceptionally difficult. At times attacks which appear to be aimed at
civilian targets were nothing of the sort - the cadre may have had
information to the effect that an SADF or SAP g roup would be present at
a particular railway station or hotel or restaurant a particular time,
but due to a range of difficulties - ranging from faulty intelligence to
devices which malfunction and accidentally go off at the wrong time - an
explosion occurs, apparently senselessly, in a civilian area. It is also
possible that some of these incidents occurred through deliberate
disinformation, in which infiltrators into MK units set up attacks of
this nature.

At other times, an attack would take place in support of campaigns or
other struggles taking place within the community - such as strike
action, mass retrenchments, a rent or bus boycott. An explosion at an
office block, factory or chain store makes sense in this context,
although the timing of the blast could go wrong for a range of reasons
and result in unintended civilian casualties.

In some cases, cadres were entirely correct with regard to the political
reasoning behind their choice of target but placed a bomb at an
inappropriate time which resulted in unnecessary civilian casualties. In
addition, they did not have sufficient capacity to convey the intentions
of their actions, or were blocked from doing so by censorship.

At times insufficient training could have resulted in situations in which
cadres were not able to ensure that explosions took place at the intended
time, or accidents occured. Technical failures also occurred, resulting
in unintended civilian casualties.

False flag operations 

The regime did not only block ANC communications of all kinds. It saw the
active dissemination of disinformation as a critically important aspect
of its programme of counter-revolutionary warfare, in which much emphasis
was laid on psychological and strategic communication operations. A
central concern of successive apartheid regimes has always been to
alienate the people from MK and the ANC. No effort was spared to
discredit and demonise MK - and certain attacks on civilian targets
portrayed as the work of MK were carried out by the regime, such as the
KwaMakutha massacre. In this regard the regime was drawing on the
experience of other wars against liberation movements, including the
tactics adopted by the security forces in the Zimbabwean war of
liberation, such as pseudo operations in which they would attack
civilians whilst masquerading as guerrillas. The tactics developed in
Namibia in attempts to counter-mobilise the civilian population against
Swapo were also harnessed (see our main submission, pp 35 - 36.)

In the mid- to late 1980s, the situation was further complicated by the
stepping up of false flag operations as the regime intensified its
efforts to discredit the ANC internationally, and alienate growing
popular support on the ground. Various examples of work of this nature -
such as the Khotso House bomb and the murder of Griffiths Mxenge were
cited in our main submission, and there is little doubt that several
other operations of this nature will come to light as the work of the
Commission proceeds.

In some cases agents infiltrated structures and consistently attempted to
influence people towards un-planned or ill-considered violence, in order
to discredit the ANC, create divisions in communities, and disrupt
structures.

There have been indications that some of those who have applied for
amnesty have information on the extent to which false flag operations
were carried out in the 1980s and 1990s. We call on the TRC to ensure
that all available information on covert projects, including what the NP
has called disinformation projects approved during this period is
obtained, in particular strategic communications projects, which were
controlled by a sub-committee of the State Security Council. Considerable
detail in this regard was presented in our first submission, pp. 34 - 40.

Paul Erasmus, a member of the SAP security branch tasked with stratkom
(strategic communications) work, has stated that a number of the limpet
mines that exploded in central Johannesburg in the late 1980s, for which
the ANC was blamed, were planted by the security police in order to
discredit the ANC. Joe Mamasela has made similar claims regarding blasts
in certain Wimpy Bars. We trust that the TRC will ensure that the truth
in this regard is exposed.

Response of the leadership 

In late 1987, all members of MK HQ were called in by OR Tambo, who
expressed his concern at the number of unnecessary civilian casualties
which had occurred in certain attacks, particularly those involving the
use of anti-tank landmines. He tasked MK HQ with ensuring that all cadres
fully understood ANC policy with regard to legitimate targets. Failure to
comply with these orders would be considered violations of policy and
action would be taken against offenders.

In response, MK HQ sent senior commanders to the forward areas to meet
with MK structures there, and convey the concerns of the national
leadership. When possible these senior commanders also met with units. In
cases where meetings could not be held with units, command structures in
the forward areas were told to contact all command structures of their
units, whether they may have been involved in attacks of this nature or
not, and ensure that all cadres were entirely clear on ANC policy
regarding legitimate targets.

Chris Hani, Aboobaker Ismail and Keith Mokoape visited structures in
Maputo; Ronnie Kasrils visited structures in Swaziland and other areas.
Lambert Moloi, Chris Hani and Julius Maliba (Manchecker) met with
Zimbabwe structures, and Chris Hani, Aboobaker Ismail, and Lambert Moloi
visited Botswana structures.

In most cases cadres responsible for these actions had not deliberately
set out to flout ANC policy, but had believed they were acting in
accordance with the wishes of the leadership, or had acted in anger. This
was particularly the case with younger, more recent recruits. Conveying
the instructions of the leadership in this unequivocal manner through the
most senior officials of MK HQ was sufficient action, as the overwhelming
majority of MK cadres were disciplined soldiers and activists.

In August 1988 the NEC issued a statement specifically on the conduct of
armed struggle in the country: "The NEC further re-affirmed the
centrality of the armed struggle in the national democratic revolution
and the need to further escalate armed actions and transform our
offensive into a generalised peoples war. (...,) However, the NEC also
expressed concern at the recent spate of attacks on civilian targets.
Some of these attacks have been carried out by cadres of the peoples
army, Umkhonto we Sizwe, inspired by anger at the regimes campaign of
terror against the oppressed and democratic forces, both within and
outside South Africa. In certain instances operational circumstances
resulted in unintended casualties."
"Yet it has come to our notice that agents of the Pretoria regime have
been detailed to carry out a number of bomb attacks deliberately to sow
confusion among the people of South Africa and the international
community, and to discredit the African National Congress." 4.4. Post
1990: Suspension of armed operations 

Most MK MHQ personnel returned from exile for the December 1990
Consultative Conference. After this conference, MHQ awaited further
instructions from the NEC with regard to its role and future direction.
MK cadres inside the country had begun surfacing and coming to the ANC
office to seek guidance. A rudimentary structure was set up to look after
the needs of these cadres while awaiting policy decisions from the
political leadership.

The ANC had taken a principled decision to release agents of the regime
who were still imprisoned in Uganda at this time as part of the process
of furthering the negotiations. However, the regime did not reciprocate
and many ANC cadres, especially those on death row, were only released in
1992 after the signing of the "Record of Understanding".

The Groote Schuur Minute, the Pretoria Minute and the DF Malan Accord
determined the future of MK activities.

The armed struggle was suspended in August 1990 with the signing of the
Pretoria Minute. It was decided that those MK cadres who were outside the
country - in camps or in the Front Line States - should undergo further
training to prepare them for integration into a new South African Defence
Force. Limited numbers of cadres were sent for advanced officers training
in conventional warfare. Countries including India, Ghana, Pakistan,
Uganda and Tanzania hosted these cadres.

In terms of the Pretoria Minute the ANC had agreed to stop bringing arms
into the country. The DF Malan Accord of 1992 aimed to bring the arms of
all the armed forces in the country under control. However, the De Klerk
regime interpreted the Accord to mean that this applied only to MK;
various negotiations ensued, without resolving the matter.

We dealt with the issue of SDUs in considerable detail in our first
submission, and our responses to questions raised by the TRC in this
regard are dealt with in the main document of this second submission. It
will suffice to note that SDUs were formed in response to the violence
which erupted as the ANC suspended armed struggle. In response to pleas
for assistance from communities under attack, the ANC tasked some members
of MK Military HQ to attend to issues relating to SDUs, their
organisation, training and the provision of weaponry. It was made clear
that SDUs would be exclusively for the purpose of self-defence, that the
overall control of SDUs was to remain with the communities concerned, and
if MK cadres participated in SDUs they would do so as members of the
community: MK Command would not play a leading role, as it was felt this
might jeopardise negotiations.

In 1991, MHQ organised a conference for MK in Venda to inform cadres of
the state of the negotiations and to get their views on the future of MK.
The conference was attended by representatives of cadres from inside the
country as well as those in camps in Tanzania and Uganda.

The Venda MK conference supported the decisions taken at the ANCs July
conference in Durban, and called on the ANC leadership to secure the
release of MK combatants who were still in prison. Cadres called on Chris
Hani to remain MK Chief-of-Staff.

The conference also called for a reorganisation of MHQ with the view to
preparing for serious negotiations with the regime on military matters
and a future defence force. It was decided that multi-lateral talks would
be held with all forces within the country, and that the homeland armies
should be discouraged from individually holding bilateral negotiations
with the SADF.

Following the Venda Conference, the ANC re-organised MHQ (details in this
regard appear in the appendix on ANC structures and personnel.) Regional
structures were established in each of the ANCs 14 organisational regions
and cadres appointed to liaise with MK personnel living in these areas.

By this time, in preparation for negotiations, MHQ had begun to have some
contact with the SADF.

There was increasing pressure from the military camps from cadres anxious
to return home. Once negotiations appeared to be proceeding relatively
smoothly at Kempton Park, the return of these cadres was speeded up.

After initial bi-lateral negotiations between MK Command and the SADF, we
went on to have multi-lateral negotiations with the seven existing armed
forces in the country. MK and other forces participated in the Joint
Military Co-ordinating Council under the Transitional Executive Council.

In December 1993, MK held its final parade. After the elections, the
integration of all members of all armed forces into a new SANDF began in
earnest in May 1994. Later that year, the weapons that were in MK
Ordnance stockpiles were handed over to the SANDF. Other weapons were
collected and handed over. The President decided that all MK arms
stockpiled in foreign countries should he donated to those countries;
they were not compatible with those used in the SANDF.

5. CASE STUDIES 

We have selected two case studies - one from Special Operations, the
other from general military operations - to illustrate some of the points
regarding the conduct of armed struggle that we have highlighted in our
submissions to the TRC. Operations such as the attack on SAAF HQ and the
laying of anti-tank mines have been seen in some quarters as
contradictions of ANC policy regarding the avoidance of civilian
casualties.

The SAAF HQ operation illustrates the problems which arose as a result of
the enemy locating strategic installations in high-density civilian
areas. In the section on anti-tank landmines, we provide the TRC with
more detail on the objective of these operations and the operational
difficulties which arose.

5.1. The Attack on SAAF HQ 

This operation came in the wake of a cross-border raid into Lesotho in
which 42 ANC supporters and BaSotho were killed, and the assassination of
Ruth First in Maputo. The objective was to carry out a highly visible
attack, which was impossible to cover up, against military personnel in
uniform. No direct operations had previously been carried out against
military personnel except for a number of skirmishes between MK cadres
and the security forces, usually in the remote border areas.

It was decided to target military personnel who waited for buses outside
SAAF HQ at approximately 16h30 each day. In the early stages of planning
this operation, discussions were held on the possible loss of civilian
life, and whether this would be justified. After careful consideration it
was decided by OR Tambo, in terms of the mandate he had been given by the
NEC, that Special Operations should proceed with the operation, taking
great care to ensure that the target was unmistakably military.

On the afternoon of May 20th, 1983, the unit drove into Pretoria and
parked the car packed with explosives in Church Street, at the entrance
of Air Force HQ. When the bomb exploded a few minutes earlier than
planned, 19 people were killed, including both MK cadres and 11 Air Force
officers, According to initial media reports, more than 200 military
personnel and a few civilians were injured, but these figures were later
distorted by the government in an attempt to portray this attack as aimed
at civilians.

5.2. Anti-tank mine operations 

The ANC never used anti-personnel mines, specifically because we were
concerned to avoid civilian casualties. The ANC used only anti-tank
mines, which require at least 300kg to detonate. The objective of these
operations was to strike at the SADF personnel patrolling borders, and at
the Commando units consisting of farmers linked to the area defence
systems within the overall security network. The areas in which these
operations took place were primarily the designated areas along the
Botswana, Zimbabwe and Swaziland borders.

In 1979 the Promotion of Density of Population in Designated Areas Act,
No. 87, was passed in an attempt to stem the exodus of white farmers from
border areas, and increase the number of farmers in these areas to serve
as the first line of defence against the infiltration of guerrillas from
neighbouring states. At least R100m was made available over a period of
five to six years for the provisions of loans to such farmers, and for
the construction of strategic roads and airstrips in these areas.

The Act stipulated that loans be given on condition that farms were
managed according to SADF directives, and that all white farmers in the
areas had to undergo military training, be members of the regional and
area commandos, and make themselves available to the SADF and Department
of National Security to carry out reconnaissance and intelligence tasks
whenever called on to do so. All were linked into the Commando system of
part-time SADF forces and the military radio network known as MARNET.
Many farm buildings were constructed in such a way as to constitute a
chain of defence strongholds along the borders ready to be used by the
SADF whenever necessary. The Act stipulated that the SADF was empowered
to enter any property in the designated area to demolish or erect
military facilities or any other structure without the consent of the
owner. (For more information, please refer to p. 59 of our main
submission.)

These measures were not only defensive: Messina, Louis Trichardt,
Alldays, Ellisras, Thabazimbi, Zeerust, Piet Retief, and Amsterdam were
all key towns from which acts of aggression were launched against
neighbouring states.

The tactic adopted was to lay anti-tank mines overnight so that they
would be triggered when the SADF patrolled first thing the next morning.
Roads in the immediate border area were used primarily by the SADF and
farmers actively supporting the efforts of the SADF, thereby defining
themselves as legitimate targets. Most farm workers went on foot and
would, it was reasoned, not be affected.

The decision to use landmines and the choice of area of operation was
made at Military HQ; the commands were based in Zimbabwe and later, for
operations in the Eastern Transvaal, in Swaziland.

Units would be sent into the country to conduct reconnaissance with the
aim or determining the movements of enemy personnel on the roads, their
routines and schedules, the habits of local people, etc. This usually
took a few days; once the reconnaissance had been completed, cadres
reported back to their commanders. Operational plans were drawn up, and
the reports and plans were then sent to Military HQ. When operations were
approved, detailed implementation plans were drawn up and cadres
instructed to lay the mines.

Initial operations were carried out fairly close to the borders - within
2-4 km. However OR Tambo ordered that operations should be carried out
deeper inside the country as the governments of neighbouring countries
were coming under pressure from the apartheid regime. The effect of this
was to move some operations into areas where the roads were not used
almost exclusively by the defence force and Commando farmers. In
addition, because cadres had to be in the country longer there was an
increase in the number of firefights between guerrillas and the security
forces.

When it became apparent that the landmine operations were not having the
desired effect of consistently striking at security forces, they were
suspended by MHQ.

5. APPENDICES: MK OPERATIONS AND OTHER ARMED ACTIONS 

It is not possible to give a detailed account of every MK operation, as
requested by the TRC. We did not keep records of this nature, mainly for
security reasons. More detail will be forthcoming in applications for
amnesty by various commanders and combatants.

There are two lists of armed actions attached to this submission.
Appendix 4 provides information on operations carried out by members of
MK, arranged chronologically and according to the nature of the target in
each case. It is drawn from reports, recollections of the MK commanders,
press reports, and the SAIRR annual surveys. There are probably
omissions, and some mistakes may have occurred due to incorrect reporting
or a range of other reasons.

The incidents and attacks listed in Appendix 5 fall into the grey area
described above. We are not certain that all these attacks were carried
out by MK personnel or by people trained by MK personnel. We cannot state
with certainty what the objectives of these attacks were, but it is
probable that many were carried out in good faith in the belief -
incorrectly at times - that the cadre was acting in accordance with the
injunctions by the leadership to intensify the struggle at all costs and
carry the struggle to white areas. In other cases we strongly doubt that
our cadres were responsible, but do not have sufficient information to
substantiate this.

6. CONCLUSION 

In the course of war life is lost. The challenge before us was to avoid
indiscriminate killing of civilians, which MK certainly had the capacity
to carry out. Although it is possible that entirely accurate statistics
will never be known beyond any doubt, it is evident that MK acted with
great restraint.

This record should be compared with the many thousands of deaths of
civilians at the hands of successive apartheid regimes - with this
continuing right until April 1994 - in countless massacres,
assassinations, and executions. In addition there have b een millions of
civilian casualties - bloodshed of holocaust proportions - in wars waged
by surrogate forces in neighbouring states.

We also register our deep regret for the deaths of innocent civilians
killed in the course of the struggle for justice and freedom. We extend
our condolences to the families of all those who were killed or injured,
including the soldiers and police wh o fought against us. The taking of
life is not an easy thing; to us all life is sacred, and we have never
been callous in our struggle.

APPENDIX FIVE

ARMED ACTIONS FOR WHICH TARGET CATEGORY AND/OR RESPONSIBILITY IS UNCERTAIN


Please note:
This list includes all incedents we have found in press reports and from
SAIRR annual surveys which cannot be classified according to the target
categories used in the appendix headed "list of known MK operations". In
addition, we are uncertain as to whether these attacks were carried out
by bona fide MK cadres. Some appear to be the result of operationla
difficulties; others very probably "flase flag" operations.

were Daya Rengasami and his wife Navi. He had been a member of the SA
Students Organisation and the BPC. The ANC in Lusaka denied an SABC
report that it had claimed responsibility; other reports claimed that the
ANC had prepared a statement on the blast which was held back once it
emerged that the Rengasamis were casualties of the bomb. Rajbansi said he
believed his offices nearby had been the intended target of the bomb. The
investigating officer was Capt. Andrew Taylor of the SB who is one of the
accused in the Mxenge trial; he may be able to supply more details.

OPERATIONS REPORT:
The Department of Intelligence and Security of the
African National Congress

1. INTRODUCTION 

The conditions which led the ANC leadership to adopt armed struggle as
one of the "four pillars" of struggle for the liberation of South Africa
have been described in some detail in our main submission.

The roots of NAT can be traced to the establishment of a military
intelligence unit in the 1960s, tasked with undertaking reconnaissance
missions to find routes for the infiltration of trained MK cadres; the
establishment of reception areas inside the country for these cadres; and
the selection of inanimate targets for armed propaganda attacks.

At this time the Department had no counter-intelligence capacity: there
was no structure specifically tasked with the screening of recruits and
exposure of agents in our midst.

In the 1960's, cadres were carefully recruited or selected by ANC
branches inside the country before being sent abroad for military
training.. This screening and selection process inside the country
resulted in a degree of complacency in the ANC's mission in exile.

These weaknesses were exploited by the intelligence services of the
apartheid regime, which managed to infiltrate some of its agents into ANC
and MK structures. They went about their missions aimed at destroying the
ANC's exile mission unhindered, since no professional structure existed
to thwart their operations. In addition, Pretoria extended its defensive
and offensive capacity through forging alliances with the intelligence
services of neighbouring colonial states, and was also supported in this
regard by a number of Western powers.

The ANC achieved some success with infiltrating cadres back into the
country but in most cases they were quickly tracked down by the regime
before or immediately after they had accomplished their missions. These
cadres were arrested, usually tortured, imprisoned and later banned, or
at times executed. The suspicion grew that the regime was well informed
of MK's plans, and it was decided that the situation could not be allowed
to continue unchecked. It was decided at the Morogoro conference that a
Department of Intelligence and Security should be formally established,
tasked with the protection of human and material resources of the ANC.
Moses Mabhida, who was appointed head of this Department, was also head
of MK's Training and Personnel section. This unit was tasked with
establishing military training camps in Africa, and arranging courses in
military training in sympathetic countries.

This was a huge mandate, entailing several different sets of tasks. Under
ideal conditions, these tasks would have been carried out by clearly
demarcated structures and personnel trained in various distinct skills.

In reality, as the tasks before the Department increased over the years,
it came to assume the roles of Military Intelligence,
Counter-Intelligence, Military Police, VIP protection, and correctional
services in a relatively ad hoc fashion. In addition, from the late
1970's onwards, the Department began to build its strategic intelligence
capacity, capable of forewarning the leadership of enemy moves, rather
than merely being on the defensive. Besides this broad range of tasks,
the head of the Department had the responsibilities of ensuring that all
training camps were properly run, arranging specialised courses, and
ensuring that only trusted cadres were sent on further training or on
missions inside the country.

Despite these problems, the Department worked at improving its capacity
and scored some major successes. In 1981, when an MK cadre died as a
result of a beating ordered by Kenneth Mahamba, the commander of the camp
where this incident had taken place, the case was investigated by NAT.
This investigation facilitated a major breakthrough with the discovery of
an extensive network of infiltrators in a number of countries, some of
whom were linked not only to Pretoria, but also to the intelligence
services of some Western powers.

As we mentioned in our first submission to the TRC, some of these agents
had managed to move into important strategic positions within the
structures of the Movement. Analysis of the activities of some of these
agents in the political context in which they took place indicated that
they were not merely involved in various attempts to disrupt or damage
the ANC, but were actors in a far broader and more ambitious operation by
the regime to eliminate and replace key leaders of the ANC, thereby
setting the movement on a new route which would culminate in its
destruction.

Given the very limited resources accorded to this Department, the trying
physical conditions under which it worked, the nature of missions with
which enemy agents had been tasked by their masters, and the lack of
training of cadres in certain duties (such as prison services), it was
probably almost inevitable - but by no means excusable - that regrettable
incidents occurred. The lack of clearly defined lines of authority at
times exacerbated these problems. These issues are dealt with more fully
in the main document of this second submission to the TRC.

Because of its past achievements in disrupting enemy attempts to destroy
the ANC, and the danger potentially posed by this Department to the
success of the many covert operations which were running during the
negotiations era, this Department was targeted for sustained attack by
the former apartheid regime's stratkom structures. The perception has
been deliberately created in some quarters that the Department became a
monstrous and lawless force which terrorised ANC members in exile, and
killed large numbers of detainees or "dissidents." While our main
submission will deal with some of these issues, this operational report
will also serve to dispel some of the mythology and disinformation
surrounding the work of the Department.

We will provide a clearer picture of the evolution of the Department, the
nature and scope of its activities, and the context in which they took
place.

2. EVOLUTION OF THE  DEPARTMENT 

2.1. From 1969 to the  June 1976 Uprisings 

The Department was first established in April 1969 under the late Moses
Mabhida.

The Morogoro Conference, held in 1969, assessed the first phase of the
ANC's armed struggle. The Revolutionary Council (RC) was established and
was instructed by the NEC to concentrate on the home front: developing
internal structures, gaining publicity for the ANC, and waging armed
struggle.

During this period, the embryonic Department had no formal structure, and
all members of the Department were also members of MK. Intelligence
gathered was primarily on routes back into South Africa and on inanimate
targets. In addition to this these tasks, the physical security of the
President was attended to.

2.2. June 1976 - Kabwe, 1985 

The 1976 Uprisings ushered in a new era for the Department. The sudden
mass influx of new recruits to some extent rendered screening procedures
ineffective This infusion of new blood into the Movement, though
welcomed, was equally fraught with danger since the regime was quick to
exploit the situation by sending in several agents to infiltrate the
Movement.

It soon became evident that some agents had escaped the screening
procedures of the time. There was an attempt to kill about 500 cadres by
poisoning their food in the infamous Black September episode of 1978.
This was followed by the aerial bombardment and destruction in April 1979
of Nova Catengue military camp, which indicated that the enemy had good
intelligence. However, the Department had received forewarning of the
attack, and the camp was evacuated in time.

In response to these threats, certain cadres were selected and sent for
specialised training in Security and Intelligence work in various
countries, mainly the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.
The latter courses were different to previous ANC courses followed by all
MK recruits, which centred on Military Combat Work, with Security and
Intelligence forming only a part of the course. This training emphasised
that the use of force was counter-productive, and stressed the use of the
intellect.

MK personnel sent for training in intelligence work qualified in the
period from 1978 - 1979. On their return, they joined the 60's generation
of officers, and NAT began to take shape.

Screening procedures were improved and re-organised, with the
introduction of a standard questionnaire for all new recruits.

Regional structures were reorganised. Reception centres to screen all new
recruits were set up in Forward Areas. The Department concentrated on
Angola first, where screening procedures had as yet not been formalised.

Investigations into the poisoning ('Black September') of 1978 and the
bombardment of the Nova Katengue camp in 1979 continued. These cases were
solved only some years later.

Other changes followed. Camp 32 (later called the Morris Seabelo
Rehabilitation Centre) was established in 1979 near Camp 13 (Quibaxe) in
Angola in order to create a means to contain and rehabilitate cadres who
had committed offences, and to imprison enemy agents who could not be
isolated in the other military camps.

By 1981 a National Directorate of NAT had been appointed by the NEC, and
the Department was organised into three main sectors: Intelligence,
Security, and Processing of Information.

A number of agents were identified as a result of these improved
screening procedures. The information gleaned in this manner was
augmented by several voluntary confessions, and ongoing investigations
into earlier cases of sabotage. It was evident that the apartheid regime
felt confident and had adopted a very arrogant attitude, telling some of
these agents that they had nothing to fear from the Department even if
they were discovered: they would merely be given political education and
released, they were told, and would be able to resume their activities as
agents. To some extent, this was true. But in 1981, the Department dealt
a heavy blow to the enemy when it uprooted its most prized network of
infiltrators. This operation was popularly known as Shishita (the report
prepared at the time on this network has been submitted to the TRC.)

2.3. Kabwe to Negotiations: 1985 - 1990 

As we stated in our first submission, with this being dealt with in more
detail in the main submission to which this report is attached, a number
of decisions were taken at the Kabwe Conference specifically to halt the
abuses that had occurred by members of the security department of NAT, to
reorganise and improve the functioning of the Department, to improve
conditions under which prisoners were held, and to ensure that
investigations and sentences were carried out fairly, with the accused
entitled to proper legal representation.

The most important of these were the establishment of the Review Board
and the Office of Justice, both of which reported to the President's
office. NAT would in future send reports on its investigations into
suspected agents to the Office of Justice, which would take over from
that point. The Review Board would broadly act as a court of appeal.
(Considerable detail on these structures has been presented in our first
and second main submissions, and they are also covered in the report of
the Motsuenyane Commission.)

It was decided to remove Mzwai Piliso from his post as head of the
Department, and an interim Directorate was set up under Alfred Nzo,
consisting of Joe Nhlanhla, Jacob Zuma, Sizakele Sigxashe, and Tony
Mongalo.

This provisional Directorate was tasked with restructuring the Department
in order to ensure that its practices were in line with the new
structures for justice established after the Kabwe Conference,
investigating the style of work within the Department, and assessing its
ability to respond to the changed circumstances of struggle within the
country and in the international arena.

The NEC had declared Angola a military zone between 1983 - 1986. NAT in
Angola fell under Military HQ during this period. In 1986, a meeting was
held between MK and NAT, chaired by OR Tambo, in which the vexed question
of lines of authority over NAT in Angola was addressed. The delegations
committed themselves to ensuring that the NAT Directorate would be in
command of NAT cadres deployed in Angola and that they would report only
to the NAT Directorate in Lusaka.

In July 1987 the new permanent Directorate of the Department was
appointed by the NEC. Joe Nhlanhla was appointed the Director, with Jacob
Zuma as Deputy Director, Sizakele Sigxashe as head of the Central
Intelligence Evaluation Sector (CIES) Simon Makana as Administrator, Tony
Mongalo, and Daniel Oliphant heading Counter-Intelligence. Most of them
were members of the NEC.

NAT was restructured into more clearly defined Intelligence,
Counter-Intelligence, Processing, and Security sub-sectors. The task of
Intelligence was confined to investigations, on the basis of which
reports were submitted to the officer of Justice, whose office would
decide on what further action to take, The new leadership tightened up
supervision of interrogation practices, systematically investigated
conditions in detention centres, and implemented other corrective
measures where appropriate. A programme to review the cases of all those
held in Camp 32 was set in place, and the National People's Tribunal met
in Luanda in 1988 for this purpose. More details in this regard appear in
the main document of this second submission. The mutineers were fully
pardoned, demobilised, and sent to Tanzania to be re-integrated into the
civilian structures of the ANC in 1989. Plans were drawn up for a modern
prison in Uganda.

By this time, the ANC's intelligence structures had begun to function
within the country and was assisted by various MDM networks, and contacts
within the intelligence services of the regime. This led to greater
confidence, efficiency, and a greatly improved intelligence capacity in
general. It became relatively easier to cross-check biographies, follow
up on accusations, investigate suspicious tendencies, and obtain advice
on possible agents from activists and cadres inside the country.

NAT built up an extensive dossier of files on agents; this was not
guess-work, but hard information on the names of their handlers, their
force numbers, their grading by the SB, their activities and contacts.
The dossier was updated regularly with fresh information from inside the
country. The extent of infiltration of anti-apartheid structures was
immense, running to thousands of agents.

2.4. The Negotiations Era:  1990 - 1994 

All ANC camps in Angola were closed down in 1989, including Camp 32. All
but 32 prisoners were released, and these were transferred to a small
prison in Uganda after negotiations with that government. In 1991 the
group of 32 were also released and allowed to return to South Africa,
where several immediately rejoined their handlers and fronted for the
SB-managed stratkom outfit, the "Returned Exiles Co-ordinating
Committee". The activities of this front are dealt with in more detail in
our first submission, and in the main document of this second submission.

The negotiations era was characterised by the worst ever state-sponsored
violence known in the country, in line with the De Klerk regime's
strategy of negotiating from a position of strength in order to extract
constitutional concessions from the ANC, which entailed covert measures
to destabilise the ANC's support base and disrupt its ability to function
effectively. Threats to the physical security of the ANC's membership in
general, its leaders and physical installations, increased drastically on
a number of fronts, from state-sponsored covert operations through to the
white far right.

By this time (at national level) the Department had six main sub-sectors:
Intelligence, Counter-Intelligence, Central Information Evaluation
Section, Security, Technical, and Administration.

The Department developed policy on the restructuring and reorientation of
the existing intelligence services; workshops were held inside and
outside the country to discuss the shape and role of a future
intelligence service in a new democratic order. Open meetings were also
held in military camps to discuss these issues and contribute to this
policy debate. Towards the end of 1993 preparations for the amalgamation
of NAT and the National Intelligence Service began.

3. ACTIVITIES OF THE  DEPARTMENT 

3.1. Protecting the ANC from enemy activities 

The posture of the ANC's NAT was always defensive. The apartheid regime
defined all ANC members and sympathisers as the enemy, and as potential
targets. The lives of the ANC leadership were con-stantly under threat;
for example, OR Tambo had to be moved from safe house to safe house on a
permanent basis.

Any organisation deemed to share the same aims as the ANC was also
considered an enemy of the state. The "enemy" included Trade unions,
particularly those aligned to Cosatu, SACTU, and the SACP. The "enemy"
included youth organisations, civics,. students groups, women's
organisations, even religious officials and groups (such as the SACC),
organisations such as the End Conscription Campaign and the Black Sash -
all who did not support apartheid, whether civilian or not, were defined
as the enemy.

There were countless attacks on the offices, activists, cadres and
leaders of these groups - assassinations, ambushes, car bombs, letter
bombs, accidents caused by tampering with cars, massacres by the SAP,
massacres and killings by surrogate forces or covert hit squads, aerial
bombardments, poisonings, petrol bomb and hand grenade attacks.

In addition, the neighbours of activists or refugees were at times
deliberately targeted in order to sow fear and alienate support. To give
just one example, the home of a neighbour of Chris Hani's in Lesotho was
blown to smithereens.

They had no respect whatsoever for the distinction between civilian and
military targets, whether inside or outside the country. Even children
were fair game. On more than one occasion the Department averted plans to
poison the food and water supply at ANC civilian installations in
Tanzania: the children at Somafco were the intended target of one of
these agents. There are countless other examples of civilians being
targeted.

The apartheid regime also had no respect whatsoever for diplomatic norms,
and attacked ANC offices in Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Zimbabwe,
Zambia, London, Sweden, and Belgium. They assassinated the ANC's
representative in France, Dulcie September; the Zimbabwe Chief
Representative, Joe Gqabi; and the Chief Representative in Lesotho, Zola
Nqini. They attempted to murder Godfrey Motsepe in Belgium. They killed
the wife of another Chief Representative in Zimbabwe, Mhlope Masondo. The
deputy Chie f Representative in Lusaka, Adolphus Mvemve was killed, and
Max Sisulu narrowly escaped with his life in the same incident. A plane
on which Steve Tshwete was travelling from Lesotho had to be diverted to
Gaborone where it made an emergency landing when it was discovered it had
been tampered with. Such examples could be multiplied.

Besides this overt aggression, the enemy also went to considerable
lengths to infiltrate agents into all organisations considered to be in
the enemy camp, particularly the ANC and MK. No effort was spared to
penetrate our structures at all levels of the Movement. The failure to
pick up enemy agents in time resulted in serious setbacks and losses.

The 1981 breakthrough profoundly shocked the ANC leadership when the
extent and sophistication of this penetration became clear. Despite this
success, other agents remained in place, some in senior positions.

Analysis of the missions of agents who were captured and confessed, or
who voluntarily confessed, shows that the primary areas of interest of
the enemy were the gathering of information on the movements of
leadership figures; infiltration routes into South Africa; MK operational
plans; lines of communication and means of transport; the location of
camps, other installations, and residences; the strength of MK in terms
of numbers of trained personnel; MK training programmes; and political
developments within the Movement in general. We lost many committed and
talented leaders and cadres through the activities of such agents, as in
the cases of Zweli Nyanda, Joe Gqabi, Paul Dikeledi, and Cassius Make to
mention just a few (see the attached case studies for more information.)
Some of these informers are yet to be discovered.

Some agents were tasked not only with passing on information of this
nature, but also with carrying out acts such as poisoning and sabotage of
essential equipment. Others were trained in the psychological warfare
field; their work aimed at destroying the ANC from within, and they
usually took on the role of agent provocateur. They sought to damage MK
and the ANC in general through stirring up dissent, tribalism or other
forms of factionalism, spreading false rumours, encouraging general
demoralisation, creating suspicion within structures, damaging
relationships, and instigating or encouraging acts of indiscipline. Given
the conditions under which the ANC was operating, such acts could be
highly dangerous and destructive.

The apartheid regime did not hesitate to get rid of its own agents when
it appeared they were about to change sides or give the ANC damaging
information. The ANC is convinced that both Solly Smith and Francis Meli
were poisoned in order to silence them. The truth about the death of
askari "September" (Glory Sidebe), the poisoning of Thami Zulu, the death
of "Fear" (Edward Lawrence) in 1988, and the extent to which poisons have
been used as a weapon by the apartheid regime, remains to be discovered.
We strongly suspect that some of those cadres and activists who died of
"natural causes" may have been in fact victims of poisoning or other
chemical agents: for example, an agent was assigned the task to use a
chemical of some kind on the food of Dullah Omar, which would induce a
heart attack, according to his handlers.

The introduction of rigorous screening methods at the beginning of the
1980's was therefore not the result of paranoia or hysteria: this was a
matter of taking obviously necessary steps in self-defence, given the
nature of the enemy we faced.

3.1.2. Screening volunteers and recruits 

Reception centres were established in Angola and in the Front Line States
bordering South Africa to receive and screen all new recruits. Indicators
such as inconsistencies in biographies, false statements, unconfirmed
accusations, and certain patterns of behaviour were used to identify
possible suspects. Despite their training, many agents feared having to
face NAT, and confessed readily. Many felt little loyalty to their
apartheid masters.

As noted earlier, by the late 1980s NAT had substantially improved its
intelligence capacity inside the country, and had compiled an extensive
dossier of hard information on agents, which was updated regularly with
information from inside the country, and as a result of other
investigations and confessions.

Among other duties, NAT members in the forward areas (the Front Line
States) were tasked with the gathering and analysis of information on the
strategy and tactics of the regime, its surrogates and supporters;
recruitment of activists to the ranks of the Movement; the screening of
new volunteers and recruits; and the training of operatives who were
based inside the country. Such training included methods of gathering
information in areas of interest to the ANC.

At times we knew in advance that certain agents were being sent into the
field, and were able to confront them with detailed information as soon
as they arrived: in these cases agents confessed within minutes, since it
was obvious that they could not deny the information NAT had on them.
Keith McKenzie and Patrick Dlongwana provide examples of this nature. In
other cases, NAT would lure agents out of the country, feigning ignorance
of their treachery, and confront them with information when they arrived.

The sloppiness of the SB (which accounted for the overwhelming majority
of discovered infiltrators) also assisted NAT at times, and resulted in
agents being picked up immediately - on one occasion ten infiltrators
were sent in with a weak "legend", pass ports which had all been issued
on the same day, signed by the same official, and with sequential numbers!

The screening procedure  was as follows: 

On arrival, recruits were welcomed by the official in charge, and advised
of the rules that would govern their stay in the reception area or centre
by the person in charge. The Chief Recording Officer (CRO) would formally
explain to the new arrival the necessity of providing the Movement with
his or her biography. Recruits had to supply detailed information on
their family and educational history, their reasons for leaving the
country, reasons for wanting to join the Movement, and details on the
political activities in which s/he had been involved. Biographies also
served as skills audits, and as a means of gathering valuable information
of various kinds.

Completed biographies were collected by the CRO, and handed to another
officer to study and prepare for interviewing the recruit. The biography
would be evaluated on the basis of information at the ANC's disposal,
including information from confessed agents or information on
collaborators supplied by other cadres. Biographies were also
cross-checked against biographies written by other recruits where there
were points of similarity (such as the area from which recruits came, the
organisations in which they said they had been involved, and so on.)

The preliminary interview 

When possible, an officer who was familiar with the area or region the
recruit came from would be deployed to carry out the interview. The
objectives of conducting this interview were to clarify any questions
arising from the recruit's biography.

On completion of the preliminary interview, a report would be tabled for
a panel which discussed and analysed the case. In the majority of cases,
recruits were cleared immediately. The following categories were used:

Cleared (Category A): the recruit / volunteer was considered to be
neither a security threat nor an impostor, and was cleared to join MK, be
sent to school, or for immediate deployment inside the country.

Doubtful (Category B): where the volunteer / recruit was considered by
the panel to be neither a security threat nor an impostor, but had
possibly exaggerated or embroidered her/his biography. They were usually
given the benefit of the doubt.

Confessed (Category C): In this category there were:-
1. cases of spontaneous confession. In several cases recruits
   confessed spontaneously, without being prompted or encouraged, to
   having been recruited by one or other intelligence structure of the
   apartheid regime. In a very high proportion of cases, this had
   occurred in prison, with the SB promising to drop charges in return
   for working for them. Many of these "agents" had little or no sense of
   loyalty to their "handlers", and were ill-prepared for infiltrating
   the ANC. In cases where the panel had satisfied itself that the
   recruit was telling the truth, and had no ulterior motives, s/he would
   be cleared.
2. cases of confession after an interview in which inconsistencies or
   untruths were pointed out to the recruit/volunteer (more detail in the
   next section.)
3. implausible "confessions" in which prepared "legends" or cover
   stories were used in an attempt to deceive the interviewers with
   regard to the true nature of the agent's connections, and hopefully
   lay the ground for infiltration of the Movement.
Definite suspect (Category D): in these cases the panel concluded that
the person concerned was definitely or highly probably a security threat,
since the biography showed significant inconsistencies with other
information at our disposal. In these cases, the person concerned would
be further interviewed or interrogated.

Subsequent interviews or interrogation 

If the panel felt that a biography indicated there was cause for concern,
there would be a second (even at times a third) interview in which
emphasis would be laid on discrepancies, false claims, or other questions
arising. Sometimes people confessed at this stage. Confessions were
handled in various ways.

In cases where recruits confessed after being prompted or persuaded to do
so, the panel would seek to understand the recruit's motive in
withholding this information. In some cases it was merely prompted by
fear of the consequences of confessing, without other ulterior motives.
The panel would usually clear these cases with the proviso that the
recruit would be barred from joining the military until they had
demonstrated their trustworthiness.

If concern about the recruit remained unresolved, the suspect would be
informed that the interviewers required further information with regard
to discrepancies arising in the interview process, and would be moved to
a "safe house" for interrogation.

The suspect would be confronted with details of discrepancies that had
arisen in the earlier processes of screening and interviews, giving the
suspect room to realise that the Department had specific information
which was in obvious conflict with what s/he had been claiming, which had
to be clarified. In some cases where agents had continued to maintain
their innocence through the screening and interviewing processes, it now
dawned on their minds just how grave the situation was, and some would
confess.

Various techniques were used in interrogation. It was common to ensure
that suspects were sitting in uncomfortable positions to put pressure on
them. Using force was explicitly against policy, but this did occur at
times, particularly in cases where the Department was aware that lives of
other people in the field were at stake. There were some cases in which
suspects were severely beaten, particularly before 1985.

In cases where the truth had finally come out and had been verified by
cross-checking other sources of information, this would be conveyed for
assessment to the panel, which would report its finding to the Officer of
Justice. After this, the case was out of NAT's hands. The office of
Justice would decide whether he felt there was a case, and if so,
recommended that the Tribunal hear the case. Confessions or other
information extracted under duress were unacceptable.

There were some cases where suspects would continue to flatly refuse to
co-operate, or continued to deny, at times in the face of strong evidence
to the contrary, that they were working for the regime. These cases would
also be referred to the Office of Justice.

Although screening procedures were exhaustive, we have no illusions that
some agents entirely escaped the net; others were only picked up years
later (see the attached case studies.) To illustrate the entire process
described above, of 500 new recruits who arrived in Angola for training
in 1987, the breakdown was as follows:
* Category A (cleared): 262
* Category B (doubtful): 140
* Category C (confessed): 26
* Category D (definite suspect): 14
(At the time these statistics were produced 58 recruits had not yet been
attended to i.e. gone through the screening process.)

3.2. Who was imprisoned and why; categories of prisoners 

We feel it is important that the TRC and the nation is given more
information on how the ANC handled cases in which agents confessed. Some
had been sent to infiltrate the ANC exile structures or had infiltrated
ANC underground structures inside the country and the other Front Line
States, or had infiltrated other anti-apartheid organisations. Some were
agents who had been operational in the field in violent attacks, at times
of the "false flag" variety, on anti-apartheid activists. Yet others
remained dormant for some time and spontaneously confessed some years
after being accepted into ANC structures.

A considerable proportion of those who confessed were never imprisoned or
punished. Those who voluntarily confessed on arrival or joining the ANC
were not imprisoned. Several of those who confessed after some time, when
their consciences had begun to trouble them, were never imprisoned or
punished. Some were people no-one had suspected, whilst others had raised
suspicion but we had no tangible evidence against them. Some agents had
committed minor or no crimes against the struggle, and were not
imprisoned.

People who had confessed and who had not been imprisoned were allowed to
participate as full ANC members, and were not exposed to the rest of the
ANC/MK community. They enjoyed every right a genuine cadre deserved,
except in some cases in which selected individuals were barred from being
deployed in strategic or sensitive areas of the Movement.
1. Imprisoned confessed agents = 65.58%
2. Confessed agents who were not imprisoned = 34.42%
Categories of prisoners 

There have been sustained campaigns of disinformation aimed at creating
the impression that hundreds of people were tortured, imprisoned or
killed in the ANC's camps, particularly Camp 32.

We present the following statistics based on analysis of available
information on the approximately 308 persons who were imprisoned at
various times.

The following categories of prisoners were imprisoned between the years
1977-1991: 
1. 193 confessed agents = 62.76%
2. 35 suspects = 11.38% (Detainees in this category had for various
   reasons been considered strong suspects, but did not confess. In some
   cases, we were wrong to suspect them.)
3. 19 cases in which confessions were retracted = 6.2% (These were
   people who had confessed to being enemy agents but later retracted
   those confessions.)
4. 13 disciplinary cases = 4.13% (These were cadres who were being
   punished for breaches of the ANC and MK codes of conduct such as
   refusing to recognise authority, abuse of ANC property, negligence
   which resulted in the loss of life/lives, sabotage of ANC property,
   dagga-smoking, injuring other cadres, etc.)
5. 29 mutineers = 9.31%
6. 9 deserters = 3.44% (These were cadres who had been caught
   deserting MK - a violation of the MK Code of Conduct.)
What happened to people who had been imprisoned by the ANC? 

The vast majority of those imprisoned by the ANC were released (245
cases, or 82,41% of cases.) Four escaped from custody, and two drowned
when they tried to swim across a river; fourteen died of natural causes,
usually malaria, which was rife in the region. In four cases, prisoners
died as a result of being beaten. There was only one case of suicide in
prison.

4. OUR OWN AMNESTY:  RELEASE OF AGENTS 

In several cases in the past, agents were pardoned and released. In fact
many agents were never imprisoned at all, as mentioned above.

In 1987, when the new Directorate of NAT took over, there were 115
prisoners in Camp 32. By September 1987, the number had been reduced to
81. The number of prisoners continued to be steadily reduced by releases;
in 1989, when Camp 32 was due to be closed down, all but 32 prisoners
were released; of those released, only one opted to leave the ANC, which
he was assisted in doing; he opted to go to Kenya where he was granted
refugee status. All the rest, including the mutineers, were pardoned and
reintegrated into civilian or military structures of the ANC. Several
were given bursaries to study overseas, and are today successful
professionals or business people. Only the group of 32 of the most
committed agents were held after 1989 in a government prison in Uganda;
they too were released in 1991, despite the heinous crimes committed by
some of them.

Most of this group of 32 former prisoners made peace with the ANC, but
some returned immediately to their masters or came under pressure to do
so by the apartheid regime. In the case of De Souza, he apparently became
involved in gang warfare in Eersterus and was involved in a number of
cases of murder and attempted murder, including of his own wife (see the
case study on Da Souza attached to this submission.)

5. CONCLUSION 

For years, much emphasis has been placed on the unacceptable treatment
meted out to certain agents and suspected agents in Camp 32, particularly
in the period from 1981 - 1984. By its own actions to halt these
excesses, through the range of measures we have described in our various
submissions, the ANC has shown clearly that the leadership never
considered such practices acceptable. This commitment to the protection
of the fundamental human rights of all has carried through into the
policies adopted by the new government, and in the legislation which now
governs the functioning of the intelligence and security services of this
country.

The considerable achievements of NAT must also be taken into account when
assessing its role in the conflict of the past. On a number of occasions,
the Department uncovered enemy plans timeously, preventing attacks on our
camps and residences. Although Nova Katengue camp was destroyed, the
Department was able to protect cadres by receiving advance warning of the
plans of the enemy.

The extent to which the regime had managed to penetrate the ANC was
timeously discovered in 1981, as described elsewhere in our submissions.
Without doubt the greatest achievement of this Department was the
protection of the Movement, particularly its leadership core, which has
been responsible for the transition to democracy and peace in this
country - although there were some very painful failures, particularly in
the cases of Chris Hani, Joe Gqabi, Cassius Make, Dulcie September,
Morris Seabelo and other leaders and cadres who fell victim to the
assassins and raiding parties of the apartheid regime, which carried out
massacres in every Front Line State.

There was no limit to the lengths to which the apartheid regime was
prepared to go in its attempts to destroy the ANC. There were many
attempts on the lives of leadership figures, and they lived under
constant threat. For example, OR Tambo had to be constantly moved from
safe house to safe house by the Department. The same measures were taken
for the protection of Nelson Mandela during the negotiations phase.
Despite certain failures and regrettable incidents at Camp 32, we submit
that this Department contributed substantially to creating the conditions
under which it was possible to begin building the new democratic order.

APPENDIX SIX 

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MORRIS SEABLO REHABILITATION CENTRE 

1. The Morris Seabelo Rehabilitation Centre (Camp 32 or Quatro.) 

1.1. Background to the establishment of Camp 32  

Before a decision was taken to establish a rehabilitation centre in an
isolated place, the ANC leadership embarked on a political campaign of
appealing to those who had agreed to work for their enemy through being
blackmailed or because of poverty and other reasons to come forward and
confess, so that they could be pardoned. The President himself took part
in this campaign, which met with considerable success: several people
came forward and confessed.

Prior to the establishment of Camp 32, agents would be kept in the
military camps established in Angola. Negotiations were carried out with
the Angolan authorities and it was arranged that the ANC could move these
agents to local jails. However, th is arrangement also proved inadequate,
because some of the agents managed to escape back to South Africa. This
caused deep concern to the Angolan authorities. Given the fact that
Angola was just emerging from a protracted war in which South Africa ha d
played a central role, there was the potential danger that these escaped
agents could give vital information about Angola to Pretoria.

Because of these factors, the Angolan authorities granted the ANC the use
of a deserted farm to set up a facility under its control. Camp 32 was
the only place at which prisoners were held for any significant period of
time, besides the government facility in Uganda to which the occupants of
Camp 32 were sent in 1989.

1.2. Conditions on the farm  and in our training camps in Angola  

The farm was situated 200 km north of Luanda between two MK training
camps, Pango and Quibaxe. Because of the condition of the road, and due
to the war situation, it took a full four hours to travel the 200km by
car. The only available transport was shared between the three camps.

None of the three camps had running water. Water had to be fetched from
nearby streams; in the case of Camp 32, the nearest stream was 4 km away.

In the late 70's and early 80's food supplies in all ANC centres in
Angola were at times inadequate, as we relied heavily on donations from
sympathetic countries. These supplies arrived by ship irregularly and had
to be transported to the camps; Unita bandits specifically targeted these
supply lines. Supplies were shared equally amongst those in the camps,
including the prisoners. Efforts were made - with mixed success - to
improve conditions by growing vegetables and keeping poultry and pigs.
Clothing was exchanged with local people for fresh supplies.

Inadequate medical care was a problem for all members of the ANC in
Angola. Malaria was endemic. We had to rely mainly on medical orderlies
who were locally trained. Serious cases had to be referred to hospitals
in Luanda, which were ill-equipped because of the war. Adding to all
these problems there was a serious shortage of transport, which affected
all three camps.

1.3. Conditions in Camp 32 and steps to deal with these problems 

The dilapidated buildings on the farm were adapted to suit a prison
building. It had no windows but there were ventilation vents. One large
room was converted to a cell that could accommodate about 15 people; six
other rooms were converted to accommodate between 5 - 10 people and
another room was converted to host 4-6 single cells. Inmates used plastic
containers as toilets when they were in their cells, and emptied these in
the mornings.

The ANC's faith that there would never be a large number of people who
would have to be confined proved to be misplaced. The problem of
overcrowding at Camp 32 got steadily worse over the years, but was
addressed in 1987 when a programme of reviewing cases and granting
pardons began, as described elsewhere in our submissions.

Difficulties with transport, food, water and medical supplies were
general in the region, and common to all camps. The camp did have a
truck, but when it broke down it was not replaced. In the absence of
transport, inmates had to push a water tank to the nearest source of
water, a river about 3km away. The camp had no doctor, but relied on some
Medical Orderlies who were not equipped to deal with complex medical
problems. Overcrowding, and the unhealthy conditions in the cells,
created conditions for disease and did result in some deaths, although
most deaths occurred because of malaria.

There were ongoing attempts to improve conditions at Camp 32. A tractor
was obtained to alleviate the problem of fetching wood and water. A
generator was obtained, as well as a television set and sports equipment.
More medical orderlies were trained. Ventilation was improved, and plans
drawn up for the building of a modern facility (this plan was submitted
to the Motsuenyane Commission.)

1.4. Administration and Staffing at Camp 32  

The camp was under the command of the Commander; his deputy was the Camp
Commissar. The rest of the administration consisted of the
Chief-of-Staff, Chief of Logistics, Chief of Ordnance, and the Chief
Recording Officer. Commanders of Camp 32 were, successively, Sizwe
Mkhonto, Morris Seabelo, Afrika Nkwe (for a few months only), Mzwandile
Damoyi, and William Masango.

The Staff consisted of the Staff Commander and Staff Commissar, the
Communication Officer, a medical orderly, drivers, and Recording Officers.

The next layer of the administration was a platoon of guards led by a
Platoon Commander and Platoon Commissar. The platoon was divided into
Sections, each with its Section Commander and Section Commissar.

Camp 32 was staffed by members of NAT. The reasons for this anomaly arose
out of the non-existence of a defined structure -viz. military police or
at best, qualified prison warders, to take on responsibility for this
Centre.

1.5. Day-to-day life in Camp 32  

On arrival, detainees would be put in isolation cells until their cases
had been cleared. They would be issued with uniforms different from other
people in the camp. Those in isolation were exempted from participating
in any camp activities. The only people with whom they would have contact
with would be their interrogators. As soon as the investigation had been
completed, they would be integrated with other inmates in communal cells.
Each communal cell had a commander and a commissar who saw to the
discipline and general welfare of his cell mates.

Relations between guards and prisoners 

Being deployed in the camp for guard duties did not mean that the cadre
concerned was cut off from all other opportunities, but there was a
general perception that once deployed in this capacity, one's chances of
ever taking on other duties in the Movement were slim. Cadres tended to
regard the inmates as being the cause of their being what they saw as
"grounded", and this resentment contributed directly to certain cases of
abuse of prisoners. The situation was not made any easier given the fact
that some of the inmates would taunt the guards - one of the most common
insults was that the guards, fearing to go to the front areas and tackle
the forces of the regime, had pleaded with NAT to be deployed at the
rehabilitation centre where life was relatively easier and less
dangerous. This infuriated some guards.

Contrary to the general perception created by deliberate disinformation,
prisoners often got better food than the guards. This was because it was
envisaged that those who were already irretrievably lost in serving the
regime's cause could in future be used in a prisoner exchange programme,
thereby freeing some of our captured combatants. When there was a food
crisis, this policy also aggravated relations between guards and inmates.

Programmes followed at RC's 

At the RC, the suspects followed a programme which included political
education and manual chores around their 'residence'. During these
periods within the camp, armed guards would be deployed about them. The
guards were not informed of the reasons for the detention of the inmates.
Only the recording officers knew this as part of their investigations.
This is also why prisoners were given names different to their real and
MK names - to protect their identities. Usually these names were
meaningless or made reference to the offence they had committed (e.g.
Dyasop was called "APC" because he had thrown a grenade into an Armed
Personnel Carrier of the Angolan army, killing an Angolan soldier.) The
only knowledge the guards had was that they were guarding what were
called imidlwembe (traitors), as the camp was known to be a security camp.

Daily routine 

05:30hrs: General wake up call. Except for those that were responsible
for preparing breakfast, inmates did not necessarily have to follow this
programme (wake up call).

05:30 - 06:00 hrs: Morning sport. (Inmates excluded)

06:00 - 07:30 hrs: Inmates individually empty their pots and wash
themselves under armed supervision. Those who sought medical assistance
or consultation with medical orderlies utilised this time.

07:30 - 08:30hrs : Breakfast for all in the camp. It was common practise
during meals for Commissars to read and analyse the news in the communal
dining hall. Those still in solitary confinement would be visited later
by the Commissar.

08:30 - 13:00hrs : Daily duties, including the fetching of water and wood
for the camp plus the general cleaning of the camp.

13:00 - 14:30hrs: Lunch. Programme and arrangements similar to breakfast
period.

14:30 - 17:00hrs: Unless unforeseen circumstances had arisen (e.g.
insufficient water in the camp or firewood), this time was used for
leisure. Those who wished to study could use this time for visiting the
library. Others chose to occupy themselves with indoor games and
political discussions.

17:30 - 18:30hrs: Leisure time. Consultations by inmates with the medical
orderlies could also take place during this period.

18:30 - 19:30hrs: Supper.

19:30 - 20:30hrs: Cultural rehearsal.

20:30 - 22:00hrs: Leisure

22:00hrs : Curfew.

Weekend Programme The programme was similar to the weekly routine except
that inmates began their day at

06:30hrs. 08:00hrs: Breakfast was then inmates would do their washing.
Commissars would join them for discussions.

10:00hrs: Sports (football or volley ball) and indoor games. It was not
uncommon in Angola and also in Uganda for the guards to challenge the
inmates to a soccer match.

13:00 -14:30hrs: Lunch

14:30-16:30hrs: Leisure or indoor games.

18:30 - 20:00hrs: Supper.

20:00 - 22:00hrs: Leisure.

22:30hrs: Curfew.

APPENDIX SEVEN

CASE STUDIES 

Please note: 

We have selected these case studies from our files with theese objectives
in mind: 

to provide a clearer understanding of the missions and activities of
agents aof the former apartheid regime
to provide a clearer understanding of the nature of the work entrusted to
the Department in the period under examination by the TRC 

In all cases of South Africans who worked as agents, and who are not
dead, we have given only their travelling names. Foreign nationals are
named. Should the TRC require real names for a specific investigation,
the ANC will co-operate in this regard. 

We have also deleted the names of the siblings of agents, and the names
of all those who (we believe) unwittingly assisted these agents, for
obvious reasons. 

We have also deleted the names of those who agents implicated unless we
were able to verify such claims.

CASE STUDY 1 

AGENT:  RAYMOND DLANGAMANDLA (aka "Librarian") 

Recruitment

In 1967 the subject moved to Benoni. Early in 1969 he wrote a letter to
the station commander of the Benoni police, complaining of the number of
thefts in the Indian areas committed by Africans living in Wattville.

In response to his letter, he was visited by Sergeant Saddie/Sadie, who
told him that he would be paid R30 for any information he supplied to
them. He was referred to the Benoni Security Police for briefings, where
he met a Captain Van der Merwe, a Station Commander, who told him that he
wanted information on political activities. Subject accepted the task.

Work with the police 

After the death of Sergeant Saddie, Sergeant John Vilakazi replaced him
as subject's handler. The subject claims that he was receiving his R30
monthly salary although he was not submitting any information to Captain
Van der Merwe.

By 1970 the subject was running his own taxi service business, says he
lost interest in police work, and concentrated in his business. In fact
the money he was getting from them was nothing compared to what he was
making from his business. Eventually payments stopped. All the same, John
Vilakazi kept on paying him friendly visits.

It was in 1975, after the Frelimo take-over in Mozambique, that he was
called by John Vilakazi to the Security Police offices in Cranbourne,
Benoni. He was informed that Captain Van der Merwe had been promoted to a
Major, and was transferred to Germiston. He was introduced to the new
Station Commander Captain Abrie/Abrey who was to be his next handler.
Captain Abrie instructed the subject to befriend students residing at
Actonville, since he was transporting them with his Kombi from Durban to
Westville University. Later the same year, the Benoni Students Movement
was formed, but the subject claims he never managed to get any
information from them. His payment was increased to R40 or R60 per month.

After 1976 (he claims) his contact with Abrie relaxed because he was now
operating his own engineering business, the I.C. Engineering Construction
Supplies. He informed the handler about this, and did not receive any
monthly payments afterwards but continued to keep in touch with Abrie and
John Vilakazi.

Missions Assigned and fulfilled(ANC connected): 

He was instructed:

1) To try and befriend Shrish Nanabhay so as to monitor his activities.
The police suspected he was connected to the ANC/SACP.

2) To monitor the activities of Kisten Moonsamy, an ex-Robben Islander,
released in 1978. The subject went to visit him, and Moonsamy took him
into his confidence and introduced him to George Naicker.

3) Through Naicker he met Ebrahim Ismail, Poomoney Moodley, Rajes Pillay
in Durban, Amin Kajee, Rokaya Adams, Prema Naidoo, and Shrish Nanabhay.
He reported to Abrie about all these people.

4) In 1979, George Naicker asked the subject to post him a letter in
Swaziland but before posting it the subject took the letter to Abrie.

5) After Rajes Pillay had skipped the country, Naicker established
contact with her through the subject who became a courier. On four
occasions when given material like cassettes, leaflets, literature, etc.
by Rajes and Ivan Pillay in Swaziland he took the material to Swanepoel
(his new handler after Abrie) before he took it to George.

6) He was reporting all the contents of his meetings with Ivan and Rajes
to Swanepoel and was also contacting Warrant Officer Van Dyk of Oshoek
border post for clearance.

7) After the Swaziland ANC machinery discovered that the subject was a
plant, Naicker and Ebrahim were called to leave the country, which they
did in December 1980. Swanepoel instructed the subject to trace their
whereabouts.

8) The subject contacted Ivan in Swaziland, who said he did not know of
their whereabouts. In Mozambique he was informed by Idris Naidoo that
they have passed through Mozambique, and the subject went back home to
inform his handler.

9) When Rajes and Ivan proposed that he go for a crash course in Maputo,
he went to inform Swanepoel about this offer and was encouraged by him to
proceed. He also briefed the subject on how to behave.

Apprehension of Subject 

Information from a very reliable source within the police was received to
the effect that there was a police agent working as an ANC courier who
would be arriving with ANC material from Swaziland on 26/09/1980. The
material was to be dispatched to George Naicker.

When this information was compared with other information at our disposal
it was found that the subject was to go back inside the country on the
26/09/1980 with leaflets, literature, etc. to give to George Naicker. It
was beyond any doubt that the subject was the culprit and that he had
submitted this information to the enemy. It is then that George Naicker
and Ebrahim Ishmail were called outside the country, to save them from
the police.

After the two comrades had disappeared, the subject reappeared without
pre-arrangements in Swaziland, to contact comrades Ivan and Rajes. He
went up to Mozambique after he was told that they (Ivan and Rajes) did
not know where Naicker and Ebrahim were.

He was then lured out of the country by the offer of a five-day crash
course in Mozambique. His handler Swanepoel agreed to this. On arrival in
Mozambique the subject was arrested with the help of the local security
and interrogated. He willingly gave an incomplete confession. Later, when
imprisoned in Angola, he made a full confession.

Before he was locked up at Camp 32, while still kept in Viana camp, he
tried to desert the movement with the help of one local, together with
Dominic Kgati. He was then locked up at Camp 32 for rehabilitation and
released on 1/06/1987.

Given a chance, he was deployed at our regional logistics in Angola as a
Secretary. The subject managed to accumulate a lot of money, by selling
200 bags of potatoes from the stores. This was in preparations for his
intended marriage and desertion. He ultimately deserted the organisation
in 1988/1989 and sought help of the United Nations. Unfortunately for
him, he was recaptured before leaving Angola through the United Nations
and again locked up. In his possession he had 1 000 000 Kwanzas which was
confiscated.

HANDLERS: 

Captain Van der Merwe (promoted to Major), Captain Abrie, Captain
Swanepoel, Sergeant Saddie, Sergeant John Vilakazi

CASE STUDY 2 

AGENT: 

EDWARD LAWRENCE (Aliases: "Fear", "Ralph Mgcina", "Cyril Raymonds" ) 

Below we are reproducing extracts from a number of reports on this
subject:

A. EXTRACTS FROM THE 

CONFESSIONS OF EDDIE LAWRENCE (RALPH MGCINA:) 

1. According to the confession made towards the end of May 1988, he
attended the University of the Western Cape (UWC) in 1973. After its
closure due to student protests he ended up in Durban living with his
sister, while searching for a job. He could not find a job. It was at
this time that he was recruited by a white man to work for the South
African Special Branch. He made contact with SASO office in Durban and
also medical students who were politically active and submitted reports
to his handler on their activities.

2. Early in 1974 he was instructed to go back to the Western Cape and
enrol at UWC in order to monitor the political situation there. At this
time many students were leaving the country because of police harassment
and joining the national liberation movement in exile. He was instructed
to join these students, leave the country, join the ANC, study its
internal situation, gain experience, and remain dormant.

3. He made contact with the enemy again when he was deployed in
Swaziland. He was serviced by couriers who travelled to and from his
brother in law, Paul Meyer, who is a policeman in Lusikisiki. Paul Meyer
was the linkman with the main handler who is a senior Security Branch
officer (based at CR Swart Square, Durban). At this time the subject's
main task was to keep close to MHQ personnel, analyse MHQ strategic
thinking, and with time establish the main lines of ANC work in
developing the armed struggle.

4. In 1983 whilst deployed as a leading cadre in the Natal Military
Machinery in Swaziland he was arrested by the Swazi police. He knew that
one of these policemen, (name deleted) was working for the South African
Security Branch. During questioning he revealed to (deleted) the
following information about his unit in Swaziland: comrade Zweli
(Gebuza's brother) is commander of the unit; comrade Magagula is in
charge of logistics in the area; that Madolo works for Border
infiltration. He also told the police the location of the infiltration
point, told them about codes of communication and the location of DLBs.

5. Ralph was introduced by the police station commander, (deleted), to
two Boers who introduced themselves as Captains Van Niekerk and Van Der
Walt. They wanted to know about residence of ANC members. They were
particularly interested in the location of the place where Comrade Zweli
Nyanda stayed, and this happened to be the same place where Ralph was
staying. The subject described and drew a sketch of the house, which was
at Mobeni. They told him that they wanted to attack the place but needed
his collaboration to effect this plan. He agreed to do this.

6. In his words, "my task would be to alert them as to when the comrades
were asleep and to unlock the back door, switch off the outside light for
the attack, keep in touch with (deleted) and break my bedroom window to
"escape"." He did exactly as instructed by his masters and the result was
that comrades Zweli Nyanda and Keith MacFadden were killed in that raid
through his practical assistance to the Boers.

7. Also on the basis of his experience in MK work, he was also instructed
to push MHQ for deployment in the country which he did. The enemy was
confident that he would succeed in doing this due to his experience at
the front. The enemy objective was that he would develop his own
structure and also rise in MK structures inside the country. The
strategic goal of the enemy here was to allow the structures inside the
country to grow and then cut them down, but leave an embryo for the ANC
to build on and within that embryo leave its own forces so that the new
structure is also controlled. This would go on indefinitely.

Subject died before implementing this next enemy plan (details below.)

DATE OF REPORT 03/08/1988, Lusaka 

B. THE RAID IN 1983 (DEATHS OF ZWELI NYANDA AND KEITH MACFADDEN) 

"The origin of the plan to attack this residence came about as a result
of my compromise and treachery whilst in the hands of the Swazi police in
1983, a few weeks before the actual raid.

"During my arrest and detention I displayed cowardice when confronted on
the question of where I stayed. I referred them to No 6, the known ANC
flat. This they dismissed telling me that they knew all the ANC refugees
who lived there and reported regularly to the police station as was
expected of legally registered refugees. This took place in the first
sessions with Mtunga leading the questioning.

"I then had to point out some other place. I pointed out the late comrade
Nzima's flat at Mzimnene in Manzini. The following day they took me to
the flat with a number of policemen. The place was raided and three young
recruits including comrade Eddie (FAPLA) were arrested. I was not aware
that these comrades would be there. The van which had recently been
purchased was parked there. Among the items in my clutch-bag were the
keys for the van.

They, the police, went back to the police station and returned to fetch
the van. "It was after this first act of betrayal that (deleted) from
Headquarters was then involved in leading interrogations. During these
sessions there was (3 names deleted) whom I knew at that stage (through
our Security Department) was working with the Boers. At a certain stage
(delete)d from HQ told me that what information they received from me
would be kept secret. "What I exposed during these sessions was that:

- There were self-explanatory codes of communication in the clutch-bag;

- Bank statement bearing Mr Cohen's banking account number;

- There was a telephone number of Prof, an operative at home;

- There were post-keys of P/boxes which we used for communication.

"I also exposed the people I worked with, the structure, comrade Zweli
being in charge, comrade Magagula and Belgium, Magagula for logistics. I
also exposed to (deleted) the workings of border infiltration and
mentioned the Gege area as a place we used.

"At an earlier stage there was a wrangle over the van which I insisted
was not an ANC vehicle but belonged to a girlfriend of mine, (name
deleted.) She was subsequently called in for questioning and at the
initial confrontation stubbornly denied having laid eyes on me but
through reasoning and influence by the comrades outside, she came back to
change her statement and said she was my girlfriend and had borrowed me
the van. At a later stage comrade Duma was called and through his
insistence to the special branch that this was an ANC vehicle I was
forced to agree that it was.

"The station commander, then came into the scene. Earlier on I had
noticed two Boers at the police station. (Deleted) shifted me to a cell
where I was alone and threatened that he would see to it that I was
handed over to the Boers unless I co-operate with the Boers. I met these
two Boers who introduced themselves as Captain Van Niekerk and Van Der
Walt. They wanted to know our places. I revealed the house at Moneni
where the attack took place, and described and drew a sketch. They needed
my collaboration to effect this plan. I agreed to do this.

"My task would be to alert them as to when the comrades were asleep and
to unlock the back-door, and also to switch off the outside light for the
attack. I would keep in touch with (deleted). I was also to break my
bedroom window to "effect my survival". I kept in touch with (deleted)
under the guise of trying to secure back the contents of my clutch-bag
which (deleted) of HQ said he would return.

"I informed (deleted) of the trip to Maputo and the time of our
departure. I also exposed the house/farm at Malkerns where we kept
material. The house in Fairview I also exposed. These were subsequently
raided by Swazi people and weapons were captured."

THE RAID 

"On that particular evening myself and Keith (MacFadden) were busy trying
to phone Maputo to make sure that we were picked up from Lomahasha. Zweli
had gone earlier in the night to pick up Fikile whom we were to send to
Durban as a courier. When we were at home we had something to eat and had
some Scotch (liquor).

"Then around 11.30pm Zweli and I left for the house in Fairview to try
and make a last attempt to phone Maputo. We failed and he phoned home to
wish his mum happy birthday. When we reached home Keith had gone to bed.
I lay on the bed with my clothes on. I then heard cars make their way
down the road and then turn to come up. This was around 2 am or 2.30 or
so. I stole out of the house through the back-door and went to these
vehicles - a Mercedes and two vans. I told them in the Mercedes (boers)
that the comrades were asleep. I was then to move down and immediately
afterwards break my bedroom window and dash to wait by the cars.

"I broke the window and dashed into the bush. I remained there until the
attackers left and heard one of the neighbours (Marcel) at the house.

"I emerged and then went to the house. I saw Zweli lying near the gate
and Marcel checked his pulse. He confirmed he was dead. I inquired after
Fikile and was told that she had been heard by the neighbours after the
enemy had left asking for assistance which she was denied and left. I
then left with Marcel for the police where I found Fikile. I reported the
attack to the policemen on duty. I made my way back to the house with
Marcel. I saw Keith with a bullet hole in the head crouched in a corner.
It was clear he was dead.

"I covered him with a blanket and quickly looked through the house for my
travelling bag which had reports. This had been taken by the boers. I
found an executive bag with some documents which I took with me.

"I then left with Marcel for Matsapa and reported the attack to comrade
Vundla who advised that I go back to the police since I had already
reported to them. I asked him to keep the documents which I had retrieved
but said this was not possible since the Swazis may raid. I took the bag
to Reggie Msibi whom I told about the raid. I then also went to the
opposite flat to inform comrade Paul Dikeledi of the raid.

"I went back to the house with Marcel where I found top brass of the
police force - Sotsha Dlamini (CID), Edgar Hillary, Anton Dlamini
(Special Branch) and others. I gave them a brief report of what
`happened'. Their main interest was where our weapons were. They and
myself went through the house where I was pointing out the various
bedrooms. The confiscated political literature and did police work
(finger prints).

"We then had to move to the police station. I remember having to start
our cars (the Golf, the Stanza) since the cops were saying they could be
booby-trapped. On arrival at the police station I was questioned and I
gave my version of how I escaped, pointing out why I still had my clothes
on (were to leave for Maputo) and that I had broken the window when
jumping out with my back. They remarked about my `miraculous' escape. I
was then kept in one of the traffic department offices for what they
called `protective custody'. I had free movement around the police
station. I was kept there for two weeks and released into the care of
comrade Duma's custody with one of the vehicles. The other car, (the
Golf) was released into the custody of Favin, Keith's brother. My release
enabled me to attend comrade Zweli's funeral.

"During my stay at the police station it was suggested to me by (deleted)
from HQ that I leave Swaziland. My response was that I would leave per
instruction by the ANC. I was recalled by the ANC to Maputo around
December. I gave my version to the Movement. It was false.

"P.S. During the interrogation sessions with (deleted) from HQ, he asked
me about King (an enemy agent whom we had recently kidnapped about a
month ago.) I admitted knowing him, but blamed his disappearance on
comrade Zweli."

NOTE:
From the reports of the investigation panel, it is evident that the
subject was scared of writing freely about his activities against the ANC
on behalf of the South African Security Branch.

One thing is certain: the subject, like his wife, confessed only because
he was cornered. Like his wife (also a confessed agent), subject never
had the courage or the intention to face the Movement squarely about his
crimes and confess fully.

C. REPORT ON CYRIL RAYMONDS: BY `OSCAR DLAMINI' RECEIVED 04/02/1987: 

"I first met the subject in the camp, I was not very close to him. But as
he was part of the camp commissariat of which I was also a member, we
would now and then discuss some political questions. In the process I
gathered that he came out of the country in 1975 to Botswana but did not
immediately join the ANC. In fact he was one of those elements who were
anti-ANC that time in Botswana. Of course one can understand that since
people were coming from Black Consciousness and he found himself in
Botswana which was then a stronghold of BCM. But the way he immediately
became so positive to the ANC was rather too fast to be sincere. That is
my own opinion which can be wrong.

"In the camp he was very close to (deleted) who once worked in our Radio
Freedom in Lusaka and later had some security problems.

"I left him in Quibaxe for Katengue. I stayed in that camp for about five
months and left for the Party School in Cuba for two years. When I came
back he was no longer in Angola. I went for further training in the GDR.
When I came back I was again immediately sent back as the Commander of
the group of 40.

In January 1982, I went to Maputo and became the Commissar of the Natal
Urban Military Machinery. I worked with Cde Problem (Commander), Zweli
Nyanda (Chief-of-Staff), the subject (Chief of Communications) and
Belgium as Chief of Recce. Later Problem left the machinery and Zweli was
appointed Acting Commander. (...)

"Early in 1982, I left with the subject to Swaziland. I did not know very
well the area since I was once there in 1977. I was then underground
after having trained with the unit of Solomon Mahlangu in Funda. We got
the car waiting for us on the Swazi side of Lomahasha. I had no weapon
nor money for emergency. The subject had a Scorpion (pistol) and some
money.

"As we were proceeding on our journey to Manzini we were stopped by
police but we managed to run away. When we approached Simunye we could
see that a road block was being mounted. We alighted from the car and
took cover in the bush. Unfortunately it was next to the garage and the
security guards spotted the subject. They did not see me. He was
arrested. When I saw this I jumped onto one of these security guards. The
subject was freed and instead I was arrested. He did not help me but
instead ran away. When he came to Manzini he reported that I was asleep
that is why I got arrested which was an incorrect report of what actually
took place. I took this incident as a simple question of cowardice on his
part.

"In 1983 before the formation of the Natal Military HQ of which I was a
treasurer, we infiltrated Cde S'khusele to Pietermaritzburg. He found
some problems with his unit. Some members of that unit deserted.
S'khusele managed to go to the Transkei, arranged a document and left for
Lesotho. He was met by Zweli and reinfiltrated back home. He carried out
about five operations and retreated back to Lesotho and later to Maputo.
We got a report from our security that the enemy knew when he retreated
and the exact date when he was infiltrated inside the country. Up to now
we do not know who gave the enemy that information.

"When S'khusele was in Maputo he wrote a hand written report. He was
infiltrated back to Pietermaritzburg with somebody who later became a
state witness against him. During the trial of S'khusele the enemy
produced the report he had written in Maputo, saying that they got it
from a highly sensitive source in the ANC. He is serving 20 years now. To
my knowledge that report was filed in Maputo. I know because S'khusele's
unit was being briefed in Swaziland it was in my house, and the subject
did not have that report with him. Therefore it was in Maputo.

" "Later when I was in Dar es Salaam I tried to find out how did that
report reach the boers from (deleted), I was told that that report was
captured when the boers killed Zweli.

"Before the death of Zweli the subject was arrested in Swaziland. He
showed the Swazi police where he had parked the car he was driving. Later
he came with them to my house and showed them where we had parked the new
van we were using for our route recce inside the country.

"Later he came with the police to my house claiming that he was staying
there. I was about 20 metres from the house discussing with another
comrade. Unfortunately there were SACTU underground comrades in the house
coming from home and one of our comrades. They were all arrested. The
subject also pointed another house which we used for underground cadres
coming from home.

"All along he was defended by Thami Zulu. I think Thami did this because
he thought that the subject was being victimised because he once
commented that there were people who did not like the subject because he
was not coming from Natal. Such comments can be demoralising and one
feels not to confront somebody if other people would think that you are
confronting somebody on regional or tribal grounds. You become disarmed.

"Zweli died when the subject was in the same house. He did not suffer any
injury. One is not trying to suggest that everybody must die when there
is an attack.

"I was later arrested in Swaziland. Zweli's sister came to Swaziland. She
wanted to see me but could not. "In prison I was told by Cdes Alzina
Zondi and other female comrades that Zweli's sister had told them that
the subject was responsible for the death of Zweli. She had found this
from a Special Branch (policeman) she was close to. I reported this to
Thami Zulu but I was ignored.

"Before the death of Zweli we had captured a sellout who had infiltrated
us. In his confession he said the enemy knew about the communication we
maintained with him. No force had been used against him. He just
confessed and he seemed to be sincere. I was responsible for his
interrogation.

"Then came the Nkomati Accord. I was arrested. Thami Zulu and the subject
were arrested together. They had bought two cars for the machinery.
Already Swazi police knew about those cars. The one who had arranged for
them these cars was arrested later and the police were saying that he was
responsible for buying ANC cars.

"There was an old man we used for banking our money. The police knew
about this. He was later arrested and questioned about this.(Note: Fear
acknowledges betraying this man in the previous record .... CIES,
10/05/1992) "The subject had been arrested with weapons. To our surprise
the subject was released and not deported like others. In fact an
advocate was saying he was not going to defend a man who had said so much
to the police.

"I am not prejudiced against the subject. I am just stating facts."

D. REPORT ON THE DEATH OF ENEMY AGENT RALPH MGCINA DATED 28/07/1988: 

1. PURPOSE OF SESSION: 

1.1. After a thorough preparation, the panel felt that in order to
achieve better results it was necessary to begin on the involvement of
his wife with the enemy. He had previously mentioned her in the long list
of enemy agents as the first one that he was sure of.

1.2. We also had information from our source that his wife was seen in
Durban (purpose of visit not known). Ralph could have known about this.
This could not have been the first time that she went home.

1.3. Information from another source revealed that when subject's wife
left the country, she was under enemy instructions to join and inform
Ralph to join the ANC. This does not appear in the biography that she
wrote when she joined the Movement.

1.4. It was also felt that after breaking him on the above mentioned
aspect this was going to open avenues for him to reveal his handler or
handlers and how they used to communicate. From his last confession
(about how his wife came to work for the other side) it was felt that he
should be in a position to know more on how she used to work with the
other side.

2. REPORT: 

2.1. After being asked to relate about his wife, he merely repeated all
that he had revealed in the previous sessions without any additions (for
about one and a half hours).

2.2. After being asked on how many times (that he knows of) did his wife
go to SA from Bay and for what purposes, he claimed not to have been in a
position to monitor her movements when they were staying together; which
to us seemed ridiculous.

2.3. He then revealed that his wife went to SA for about 4 (four) times
as far as he knows; and never wanted to reveal the purposes of her visits
there.

2.4. He also revealed that she refused to submit her Lesotho Passport
when asked to do so; because it reflected her trips to SA and could have
led to her being questioned and discovered to be an enemy agent.

2.5. Seeing that we were all tired; we could not proceed with the session
and we all went to sleep.

2.6. When we woke up Ralph up (27/07/88) to start work, he complained of
stomach pains and wanted to vomit. We saw that we could not continue and
we decided to consult the doctor. A comrade walked to get a lift to town
since our transport had not yet arrived.

2.7. On arrival; the doctor certified him dead and informed us that he
suspects that he could have taken some poison.

E. UPDATE FROM REPORTS 

RECEIVED FROM WITHIN THE SAP "The placing of agents at high levels
remains one of the prime objectives of the enemy and this program is
conducted from the highest levels e.g. Lawrence was handled by Major
Stadler of HQ."
GROUP: BJ42

In 1977 or 1978 subject started a (love) affair with one Modise. Modise
was a uniformed member of the South African Police working at Ramotswa
Border-gate. At the time subject was working at the Gaborone General Post
Office. Modise asked subject to report to him about people who cross into

MISSIONS CARRIED OUT BY SEBENYANA MOSINKI ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN
POLICE: 

While working at January's restaurant in Ramotswa, she came to know
Gilbert Moilwa, Isaac and others to be refugees. Subject reported these
to Modise. Gilbert later returned to South Africa while his friends
proceeded to Zambia.

In 1978 subject visited Violet Pule in Johannesburg. There they took
photographs with Sadi Pule's family. Soon after that trip, Sadi Pule
visited Botswana. Sadi gave subject a passport size photograph of a
woman, named Maria, who Sadi said was goin g to visit Botswana. Sadi
requested subject to assist Maria when she arrived in Botswana. Subject
took the photographs she had taken with Sadi Pule's family and that of
Maria to Modise. Modise later returned them and subject posted them to
Sadi Pule.

Sadi was detained during 1978 by the South African Security Branch after
the visit to Botswana. In detention she was shown the photographs her
family had taken with subject and was asked to identify subject. Sadi did
not know where the enemy got the photographs. (This information on Sadi
Pule's detention is from Sadi herself).

MISSIONS CARRIED OUT DIRECTLY AGAINST THE ANC ON BEHALF OF THE SAP: 

Subject was recruited by Sadi Pule in 1982 for the Women's Section work.
She was to serve as a courier. Subject reported that approach to Modise.

Subject reported to the handlers the following tasks assigned to her by
the ANC:

Was sent inside the country to deliver ANC cloth material and pamphlets
to a certain Mapule in Mapetla, Soweto. Shortly afterwards Mapule was
taken in by the enemy.

Subject was sent to recruit several individuals in Botswana and
Bophutatswana (names deleted). Comrades Florence Mophosho and Aurelia
Gqabi gave subject a letter to deliver to comrade Albertina Sisulu.
Subject showed the letters to Modise who later returned them.

Subject reported to Modise (SB) about Lehlohonolo and that he uses a
yellow Cressida.

Modise (SB) once asked subject to monitor Clement Bogatsu, a Motswana who
is a driver at BHC. Subject reported that Clement was close to Lekoto and
Chris of Special Ops. Clement was later arrested in South Africa.

Subject reported to Modise (SB) that two cadres under Special Ops had
been infiltrated into the country by a driver of Phillip Moletsane in
Moshaneng. The driver was later arrested and allegedly recruited by the
enemy. Subject claims to have got this information from Phillip Moletsane.

Lekoto of Special Ops once gave subject a code - list and money in an
envelope and weapons for safe-keeping. Lekoto also sent subject to call
Phillip to Botswana. When subject went to call Phillip she took the
code-list with and gave it to Modise and also told him about the money
and weapons. Modise later gave the subject the code-list.

SUBJECT'S ROLE IN KILLING OF 

FOUR CADRES: 

Comrades Steve (Sebata alias Luvuyo Mzana alias Enoch Muiseng Mashoala)
and Naledi assigned subject to recruit somebody in Moshaneng to take
cadres to South Africa.

Subject went to report to Modise about her task. Modise, Langa and
Sergeant Smith (all policemen) later met subject and told her that she
would have to report to Botswana that she had recruited Mr Richard
Maduenyana. Maduenyana was also called into the meeting, (or Richard
Moduenyana or Richard Muduenyana)

Richard arrived in Botswana and was given money to buy a canopy for his
vannette in South Africa. He was also given instructions on how and where
to pick the four cadres inside the country.

Comrades Steve/Sebata/Mashoala and Naledi took the four cadres across and
went to the rendezvous. On arrival there they heard the sound of a big
truck in the bushes. They waited there until Richard Moduenyana came to
the meeting spot. When Moduenyana pulled off with the four cadres, Steve
and Naledi heard the sound of the truck again. They got worried because
they felt the truck was following the vannette. Early the following day
they heard news over BBC radio that the four cadres had been killed. The
two (Naledi and Luvuyo) instructed subject to go and check on Moduenyana.

Subject went to report on Modise (SB) about the task she was assigned.
Moduenyana was called by Security Branch police to a meeting on a secret
farm in Zeerust. Present at the meeting were Major Crouser (Crouse?),
Sergeant Smith, Wehrman, Modise and Langa (all these SB controllers).
Also in attendance were Moduenyana and subject. Here a strategy was
worked out on how Moduenyana was to handle comrades Steve and Naledi.

After the mmeting subject returned to Botswana and there she reported
that Moduenyana was going to visit Botswana the following day, that he
had sustained injuries and was treated by an Indian doctor who was his
friend in Rustenburg.

On the said day, Moduenyana arrived in Botswana. He gave Steve and Naledi
the story and showed them old wounds in his body which the comrades
believed. They arranged with him to visit Botswana for medical treatment.
The car Moduenyana was driving when he visited Botswana was riddled with
bullets.

Later Steve and Naledi sent subject to call Moduenyana when the
arrangements for his medication were finalised. On arrival in South
Africa subject met Sergeant Smith who gave her the story to pass to the
comrades, that Moduenyana had recovered.

Moduenyana was later given an Isuzu vannette with a radio (for
communication), the registration number being YBG 1345, blue in colour
with a white canopy. Moduenyana is also a member of the Opposition Party
of Bophuthatswana.

Subject received R3240 at the end of the month for the operation.

SUBJECT BETRAYS A SPECIAL OPS CONTACT AS WELL AS WEAPONS. 

Subject was introduced in Botswana by Lekoto of Special Ops to a contact
who was to receive material (weapons) in Magaliesburg. This was on the
16/12/1985. The person left Botswana same day. On the same day subject
reported telephonically to Modise (SB) and then left Botswana the
following day.

+ On arrival in Moshaneng subject phoned Modise again telling him that
she (subject) was on the way with the car loaded with material.
+ Subject telephoned the contact at Swartruggens and arranged that they
meet in Roodepoort. After meeting with contact person, who took the car,
subject was booked in a Johannesburg hotel.
+ Sebenyana was later visited by policemen Modise and Langa who informed
her that the contact had been arrested at a roadblock.
+ Meanwhile cadres in Botswana after failing to reach the contact person
over the phone decided to find out from his girlfriend. The girlfriend
told the comrades that on the same night when they received the vannette
they took it into the garage for unloading the material. After finishing
they took the vannette out and were about to leave for the hotel where
Sebenyana was put.

Outside they found policemen waiting for them. They were ordered back
into the garage and the material was found. The police took the contact
person with them plus the material and left the girlfriend behind. The
material taken by the enemy from the contact was made up of: two
car-bombs material; three AKs; grenades; money for Special Ops cadres.

The girlfriend was later detained - on the 24/12/1985 and was to be
charged for perjury when she refused to testify against her boyfriend.

The contact person was sentenced to about 18 years imprisonment.

OTHER REPORTS SUBJECT  SUBMITTED TO HER HANDLERS:

In 1985 subject met Sergeant Smith, Major Crouser, Wehrmann, Modise and
Langa. They showed subject a map of Gaborone and asked her to identify
Sadi Pule's house. Subject pointed Sadi's house in Tlokweng and another
house across the road where a female comrade lived. Two weeks later Muzi
Nkwanyana visited Sadi in Tlokweng. A week later, Sadi's house was
attacked during the Gaborone June 14 raid.

After the raid subject visited Sadi's house (which had been attacked) and
later reported to handler Modise that Sadi was safe. Subject also
reported the location of the residence of Naledi behind the Community
Centre to Modise.

In May 1987, subject phoned Smith and Modise (SBs) in Zeerust and
reported to them that Abraham Pule had arrived in Ramotswa from South
Africa and was proceeding to Gaborone. Subject also told them the date he
would be coming back to Ramotswa. Subject states: "The day before Abraham
Pule left Botswana I phoned Modise and Smith to inform them. Modise later
told me that Abraham got arrested at a roadblock having weapons..."

PAYMENTS THAT SUBJECT RECEIVED FROM THE SECURITY BRANCH: 

++ Initially Modise used to give subject R50 to R150 per month.
++ Around 1987 subject was getting about R400 per month. In May 1987 was
given R700 apparently for leading to the arrest of Abraham Pule. Abraham
was arrested in the Zeerust area when he was going to Johannesburg from
Gaborone.
++ For her role in the killing of four MK cadres in December 1985 who
were from Botswana, subject was paid R3240 at the end of the month.

MEANS OF COMMUNICATION  WITH THE SBs: 

Subject was given a radio and shown how to operate it by Smith, Modise
and Langa. Only used the radio once when handlers wanted to know whether
there were any cadres in her place. Apart from this used to use telephone.

CONFESSION OF SUBJECT: 

Subject was lured into Lusaka, Zambia where she confessed to her dealings
with the Security Branch against the ANC. This was in March 1988. She was
returned to Botswana after the authorities there demanded her as their
national. For more on that you may see the file of Enoch Muiseng Mashoala
alias Luvuyo.

CASE STUDY 4 

Jose Joachim Rebeiro DE SOUZA (aka Alex Jackson, Fernando Lopez)

DOB: 20/01/1962
ADDRESS OF ORIGIN: 454 Sheuck Avenue Eersterus Pretoria Transvaal

CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO RECRUITMENT: 

Subject's interest to work with the police force was aroused when he was
in his last year in high school. Together with 150 other school mates
(boys) they were taken to a semi-military training camp.

The camping was organised by the South African Defence Force (SADF), the
welfare organisation of Pretoria, the South African Police (SAP) and his
school viz. Eersterus High School. Main function of this camping was to
introduce and expose them to career opportunities in the South African
Defence Force (SADF) and the South African Police (SAP). It was held at
Rashoop military base outside Pretoria.

End of the same year (1979), all those who had attended this camp were
sent applications forms to go to the Police College. Subject was unable
to join the police because of his father's refusal to sign those forms,
he wanted him to get a university education.

RECRUITMENT: 

In 1980 he was recruited, together with his friend (deleted) by Colonel
Dries van der Merwe to work for him. Their task was to monitor the unrest
(1980 school boycotts) in their area, Eersterus. For every piece of
information submitted to their handler they got R200.00. The same year he
was introduced - by his handler - to Jonathan Nel of the Security Branch
who was to be his next handler the rest of his time with the police.

TRAINING: 

During 1980, a training course in fire-arms, surveillance, personal
security and politics was organised for him, in a farm outside Erasmus in
Pretoria.

MISSIONS ASSIGNED AND CARRIED OUT INSIDE THE COUNTRY: 

1) In 1981 he was infiltrated at the University of Western Cape (UWC) to
monitor and report any political activity in the campus especially about
the anti-Republic Day campaign nd people behind the formation of the
Students Representative Council (SRC).

2) In 1982 he was instructed to enroll at Witwatersrand (Wits)
University, for a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree so as to conduct
similar tasks of reporting any political activity there.

MISSIONS ASSIGNED AND CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  (First
year): 
The following year, 1983, he got a scholarship in the United States of
America (USA) through the Educational Opportunities Council. (He was
instructed and assisted by Jonathan Nel to get scholarship). In the
United States he was studying at Wesleyan University.

1) He was instructed to join anti-apartheid student groups, report on
their activities, their support on the campus and the degree of their
contact with the ANC. He was to attend rallies and demonstrations.

2) Make a list of all students who are in the institute of the
international educational programme, that is to say, all those who come
from South Africa because the boers feared that this might be the
recruiting ground of the ANC.

His contact in the United States was a lady by the name of Carla.

TASKS ASSIGNED AND CARRIED OUT DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS: 

At the end of that academic year on May 1984 he was ordered to go home
for holidays and his route had to via London where he had to meet Nel and
get new instructions for the time in London. The tasks in London were:

a) To join the South African Communist Party (SACP) and pick up
literature at its office;
b) To visit the ANC London office and also take new literature

He fulfilled both the above tasks and gave a layout of both offices to Nel

Tasks at home:

a) He went home on June, 1984 with the task of infiltrating the United
Democratic Front (UDF) up until the time he left for the United States in
August the same year.

Tasks on his way back to school via London:

a) He again went via London where he was instructed to work in the ANC
office and report on its activities and contacts with other people around
London.
b) To report on the Nothinghill Carnival i.e. the attendance of people at
the ANC's stall, their attitude and the amount of literature sold.
c) To visit the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM)'s office and pick up new

that time. Nel also took pictures of the subject, Dali Tambo and George
while they were busy working at the stall.

TASKS ASSIGNED AND CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  (Second
Year): 

At the end of August 1984, he went to the United States. He started this
academic year at Columbia University in New York. He came to this
university through transference which he applied for on the previous
year. He applied for this transference by order of Captain Nel because
Columbia University is where the anti-apartheid activities were
concentrated. His tasks there were:

a) To work for the American Committee on Africa (ACOA)
b) To join the anti-apartheid group of Columbia
c) To slowly start to consult the ANC office in New York and report its
staff
d) To report on March/April actions in 1985 and American Committee on
Africa's role,
e) To visit the Pan African Congres (PAC) office and meet its staff.
f) All the above tasks were accomplished and in addition he submitted
plans of office lay-outs.

OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE  UNITED STATES: 

Just before he went home on June 1985 holidays Nel arranged a visit to
the United States by his wife. In June, after the Columbia University had
proclaimed its disinvestment in the companies which had businesses in
South Africa, Nel ordered him to go home. The subject has participated in
these disinvestment campaigns to an extent that he even went on hunger
strike.

PREPARATIONS FOR  INFILTRATING THE ANC:

Around July 1985, while he was still on school holidays he was briefed
about his new mission of infiltrating the ANC in Africa and try by all
means to work for the International Department in Lusaka. During one of
these briefings he was introduced to a certain Fish (Security Branch
policeman) who he (Fish) claimed (deleted) was an acquaintance. Arthur
was to help the subject through to be deployed at Thabo Mbeki's office.
(Subject later withdrew the implications this person as false).

He was not to undergo any military training in the ANC. All the
information gathered was to be sent through J. Burton, Dominium Press,
P.O.Box 391813, Bramley. He then went to the United States on July and
started arranging with comrade Neil Mnumzana to go to Lusaka.

ACTIVITIES WHILE IN THE ANC (INCLUDING INFORMATION  PASSED ON TO THE
ENEMY): 
In Lusaka he used to phone Nel from the Ridgeway hotel so as to submit
reports. At one stage he received R500.00 from Nel through the Grindlays
Bank in Lusaka.

He was in Lusaka up until comrade Chris Hani suggested that he goes to
Harare and be stationed there. In Harare he used to communicate with Nel
through a certain Bruce. He gave information about ANC facilities in
Harare, personnel and places of stay including comrade Chris Hani's
movements. He even set up appointments with comrades Raphael and June so
that Bruce (contact sent by Nel in Harare) could take their pictures. His
activities led to the attack of some of our houses in Harare.

In April 1986 he went back home, South Africa, without the consent of the
ANC. On arrival at home he was detained as a cover story aimed at
deceiving the ANC.

For all his activities he was receiving R1 500.00 per month deposited
into his bank account. While he was at home he went several times to
Gaborone.

POSSIBLE DE SOUZA CONTACTS WITHIN UDF (SUSPECTS):  (Most names deleted) 

Subject was instructed by his handler Nel (Louis Pasteur Building,
Prinsloo Street, Pretoria - fourth floor, room 401) to go to UDF offices
in Khotso House for purposes of spying on their activities. De Souza
reported about the results of this visit to Khotso House to his handler,
Nel and drew the lay-out of the UDF and Afroscope offices. Later on the
offices of Afroscope were raided and all video materials which were there
were confiscated De Souza was also about to leave the country for his
studies abroad. Nel told him that he should recommend to his UDF contacts
certain `progressive' people in Eersterus area who would take over his
UDF tasks in the area after he had left the country. These `progressive'
people who were given to the subject by Nel for recommendation were (six
people who subject said his handler told him were working for NIS.) He
says his UDF contacts left with names, telephone numbers and work places
of the people recommended by Nel.

COMMENTS (CIES 12/04/1991): Comrades who were dealing with his case felt
that he had given an incomplete confession. Subject implicated a lot of
people but later retracted on account that the confession was made under
duress.

HANDLERS: Major Dries van der Merwe (subject says he is now a Colonel);
Captain Jonathan Nel; Bruce (surname unknown)

SOURCE: Confessions and Reports by Nat Lusaka, Nat Angola

DATE: 1986/1987

FILE/DOC.NUMBER 001816.

Eersterus where he apparently became involved in gang violence; he was
eventually tried for murder and attempted murder but died under
circumstances which remain unclear before serving this sentence.

RECRUITMENT: 

He was recruited by Danie Gerber of Uitenhage.

HANDLER: 

Was Lt C.Groenewald, of the South African Defence Force.

TRAINING: 

Subject went twice with Groenewald to the shooting range near Ngqalo.This
was around 1984.

MISSIONS ASSIGNED: 

He was asked to check on students who were at rallies, boycotts and
stay-aways. He was asked about where the residences of Mkhuseli Jack,
Henry Fazzie, Mike Xhego and Boy Njomba were and claims he said he did
not know.

MISSIONS FULFILLED INSIDE THE COUNTRY: 

He goes on to say the only mission he carried out was of killing a person
(unnamed) in Langa around April/May 1986.He claims he shot the guy with
two shots and the third shot he directed to the sky to silence the dead
man's girlfriend who was screaming.

Thereafter he took his girlfriend (deleted) of Mabombo street in Langa to
Port Elizabeth. He was given R100.00 for the mission and R100.00 for
submitting the gun.

INFILTRATING THE ANC OUTSIDE: 

He was forced to find a contact which would assist him to leave the
country by Gerber and Groenewald. Subject together with Vuyani Jibiliza;
Boy Njomba and Mthunzi Thoba met Lundi Shayi of Adelaide. Lundi came
after two weeks and informed them about Reverend Stofile. Groenewald had
told subject to report once he found a contact so that he could give him
something to take to the Movement.

MISSIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE ANC OUTSIDE: 

On the 16th September 1986 subject was given a blue powder (poison) and
told how to use it by one Richard who claimed he was an Instructor of
Physical Training in one of our Camps around 1984 in Angola. He was told
to promote tribalism and if possible mutiny.

He was told by Richard that our cadres eat frogs and lizards and was
shown a video cassette of people eating those things and being portrayed
as Umkhonto cadres. He was then given R500.00 by Groenewald and promised
more money by the time he comes back. He claims he gave the money to his
mother.

LEAVING THE COUNTRY: 

The following day, the 17th, he went to Alice with Lundi using money
given by Filton Kona.They met with Reverend Stofile who organised them
passports. On the 7th November 1986 they left Alice and Reverend Stofile
was arrested. They were given money by Mrs Stofile and went to
Johannesburg to Winnie Mandela who organised passports for them.They were
later briefed by Vuyisile Sefako.

On the 13th May they left for Botswana with Stelfox Godlo, Vela Qwamashe
and Motlatsi. He claims he had thrown the poison in dirty water upon
arrival in Chelston (Lusaka) he arrived in Angola in September 1987 and
commenced with training the following month (October).

MISSIONS FULFILLED IN ANGOLA: 

Three to four months thereafter he started his dirty work. He met a
person by the name (deleted) who he claims behaved in the same manner as
he was instructed by his handlers. One day he met another person during
the digging of dugouts by the name (deleted) who had shown him a weapon
belonging to one soldier (David) and he hid it in the dugout. Subject
attempted to cache other weapons in this way.

CIES ADDITION/COMMENTS:29.11.91.
He did not mention that people like Reverend Stofile and other comrades
were arrested because of his dirty job. Subject never mentioned that he
was given several warnings in the camp (Caculama) to stop spreading his
ideas of tribalism.

At some point after failing to steal the second weapon (both were SHE
Petersons) he was a sentinel at one of the Posts (ant hill) where there
was a machine gun. He had stolen a pair of pliers from the maintenance
unit and he emptied the gun powder from the first five cartridges and the
last five on the loading belt of the PKM company machine gun and later
returned the belt back to the weapon. The next sentinel never noticed.
The next morning the machine gun was taken on a convoy to Malange where
it failed to fire during a UNITA ambush. One comrade died and the Camp
Commissar was wounded. The subject was a suspect at this time since he
was also on duty in the same post.

In a second incident some time later he forced an empty cartridge casing,
with the end of the primer removed (to make sure no one discovers the
casing inside) into the barrel of another PKM machine gun.This was
discovered minutes before the convoy took off when all weapons were
checked. All weapons were inspected and that casing was discovered.

The recording officers checked all areas of suspicion and possible
suspects. This was narrowed down and the other incident of sabotage was
also taken into account. The list of possible suspects was further
narrowed down by looking at biographies of the suspects. It was found
that the subject's biography had been considered doubtful in the first
place although there had been no tangible evidence to interrogate him.

Security went to the dwelling where subject was staying, a pair of pliers
was discovered and subject claimed he used it to fix his bed and he stole
it from the maintenance unit.

Thirdly, in Luanda after the subject was removed from the camp for
investigation, his unit was taken from the camp with the legend that they
were going to get new deployments.They were given several weapons to
clean in preparation for the convoy which was bound to the Northern
Front. Subject told the investigators that he was cleaning a rifle. But
to the suprise of investigators, they discovered that a striking pin
missing from a PKM machine gun which he had assisted in disassembling.
Subject was later taken away for thorough questioning and he confessed.

CASE STUDY : 7 

False Flag Operations 

AGENT: 

MORWAMPHAGA MOJAKI 

BACKGROUND TO RECRUITMENT 

In January 1984 the subject and his friend by the name of Alfred Makene
were looking for a job at Checkers stores, where they were given forms to
fill in.

Several days later he received a telephone call informing him that there
was no work (at the store) but he should try a place in Prinsloo Street.
When he got there he was given forms to fill in. A week later a policeman
came to his place and took him to Silverton police station. Later he was
taken to Compol.

There he was offered to work with the police, which according to him, he
refused. Then he was asked to spy for the police in his township,
Mamelodi. He agreed. He was tasked to report especially on the activities
of Moses Chikane (Transvaal Secretary of the UDF), Mike Mailula, who
worked at Khotso House; and Louis Khumalo of Mamelodi Parents Action
Committee. He was also to report on the activities of organisations such
as the Congress of South African Students (COSAS) United Democratic Front
(UDF), and the Mamelodi Youth Organisation. He was told by his bosses
that he would be given training.

HANDLER: 

His handler was Johnson, of Compol Pretoria.

TRAINING: 

He received his training at a farm house in the north of Pretoria. He
spent three months at that farm house studying banned books about the
African National Congress. He received training in developing legends and
covert communication methods (coding and decoding). For the next six
months he was taken to a place called Onverwacht near the Odi/Moretele
district, between Ga-rankuwa and Mabopane townships on the way towards
Klipgat and Jericho villages. He did physical training, and was
instructed in surveillance, counter surveillance, engineering (usage of
explosives), driving and car maintenance, interviewing, interrogation,
and house breaking. In all he did a nine months training course.

MISSION FULFILLED INSIDE 

SOUTH AFRICA: 

In June 1985 he participated in the grenade attack on Louis Khumalo's
home in D Section Mamelodi East, together with (deleted) who was driving
the car, and some trainees from Hammanskraal Police College. They spread
pamphlets bearing the name of the United Democratic Front in Khumalo's
yard so as to create confusion in the ranks of the democratic movement.
He received R100.00.

The second mission (also in June 1985) was the distribution of
anti-United Democratic Front pamphlets bearing the name the Azanian
People's Organisation's name in Atteridgeville. He was given R100.00. In
around June 1985, subject took part in a night march by police in Duduza
location, Nigel, pretending to be comrades in the township by singing
revolutionary songs. The aim was to arrest the youth who were blamed for
unrest in township. The mission was a failure.

Again in June he participated in a clash between members of the UDF and
Azapo in Mohlakeng; the police were wearing Azapo T-shirts, and threw
stones at UDF members. The subject was paid R100.00.

In July 1985 he took part in the booby-trapping of explosives that killed
three comrades of the seven Duduza activists who were detained at John
Vorster Square. Subject and another black policeman acted as African
National Congress guerrillas on a mission to sabotage an electrical
substation on the outskirts of Kwathema township near Springs. He was
paid R150.00. Also in July, he participated in the hand grenade attack at
a house belonging to a member of the United Democratic Front, in Huhudi,
Vryheid, together with three others from the local police station. They
each got R110.00.

TASKS IN LESOTHO: 

At the end of July 1985 he started preparing himself to go for studies in
Lesotho at the National University of Lesotho. On the 10 August 1985, he
travelled by train from Pretoria station via the Germiston-Bloemfontein
line to Marseilles station on the Maseru border. There he met his handler
Johnson and was briefed to monitor the activities of South African
students on the campus, follow the movements of a student leader called
Kutwanakutwana and other ANC-aligned students. Johnson gave him the
telephone number 72369 and told him that when dialling he should start
with the last number (9) and end with the first number (7). He was given
the codename "Boaparo" to use when phoning.

He received a bursary from the World University Service instead of the
United Nations. Subject joined student organisations such as Committee in
Action Solidarity with Southern African Students (CASSAS) and the Union
of Namibian and South African Students (UNISAS). When he went home on
vacation he reported to Johnson on his contact with Ngoako Ramatlhodi and
Mpumulwana Tolo, who were ANC-aligned students. Subject declared himself
a refuge in Lesotho, and joined the ANC.

MISSIONS TO PERFORM WITHIN UMKHONTO WE SIZWE 

1. To draw maps of camps.

2. To note the guarding system at camps. 3. Encourage subversion and
dissatisfaction amongst soldiers.

In the event of being discovered he was told to run away to the South of
Angola and hand himself over to the South African Defence Force in
Namibia. He gave himself up to the African National Congress before
fulfilling his task.

CASE STUDY 8 

NOMPUMELELO ZAKADE 

RECRUITMENT: 

In her confession the subject had this to reveal:

She was recruited by Allan Ndlovu in Swaziland in 1985 and handed over to
Captain Ronnie Nel. Nel has been described as Head of the Elimination
Squad for Swaziland, based in Compol Building, Pretoria. There was no
contact from the end of 1985 until March 1986. She was then approached by
a Van Vuuren, whose actual name was Lange - this she discovered on
signing for the money after the death of Viva Yethu, an MK cadre.

MISSIONS FULFILLED AGAINST THE ANC ON BEHALF OF THE SECURITY BRANCH: 

She pointed out the house where Pantsu, a cadre of the Movement, was
living; he was killed early in 1986.

She informed Allan Ndlovu that September was travelling between Mbabane
and Manzini. This led to September's arrest, and eventual abduction to
South Africa. She worked in an enemy cell which included (deleted) and
(deleted.) The latter is a Mozambican renegade, who was suspected to be
an MNR member in Swaziland. Subject confirmed he was an enemy agent.

This was the unit responsible for killing Viva, an ANC cadre.

The operation was carried out as follows: subject was to lure comrades to
her place for a meal, they would be tailed from there and executed.
However, the comrades came and left early that afternoon. It was then
planned to try again on Saturday. Subject made contact with the comrades
on Friday and telephoned Ronnie Nel about this in the morning. The
comrades were kept under surveillance the whole day and in the late
afternoon the subject phoned her handler, telling him that they would
gather at (deleted)'s place that night. Subject arrived at (deleted)'s
place last and found everyone there. They were preparing to leave for a
party in Tembemile.

(Deleted) and the subject refused to go with the rest, and went to inform
Nel who was parked in the yard of the flats. The enemy had three cars, a
red Golf, a Mitsubishi and a white BMW. The Mitsubishi followed Viva's
car from the flats and the two travelled in the BMW. They went directly
to the party to enquire whether Viva and the others had arrived. They
were in for about ten minutes, on their return the engine of the car was
running and Nel was in radio contact with the other car. They travelled
straight to the scene of the execution. (Note: Subject did not actually
witness these executions as she remained in the car.)

(Deleted) and the subject then quickly checked Viva's car for anything
important. (Deleted) took from the car a pistol, house keys, about R800
in cash and a notebook from Viva's clutch bag.

Back in the car, the subject was asked about which places the survivors
may have gone to. She suggested Tod Masilela's place nearby. They were to
kill the survivors if found. At Tod's place, Tod chased her away. (The
survivors were in fact inside - note from NAT panel.)

The subject was later dropped at Mary Mkuhlase's house where she spent
the weekend. (Deleted - the Mozambican) then took the enemy to the house
where the comrades lived, which they searched and took weapons.

The killing of Paul Dikeledi and Cassius Make:

The subject was told by Paul, about two days before his death, that there
was an important person arriving with whom she could discuss some of the
financial problems she had raised with him. She later overheard (an
office worker) receiving a telephone message from Maputo for Paul that
this person was arriving on Thursday and that he should be met at the
airport. She duly informed Ronnie Nel about this.

That Thursday Paul Dikeledi, Cassius Make and a Mozambican woman
travelling with them were killed on their way back from the airport by
white persons driving a white BMW.

The subject reported on the location of houses of our comrades in Maputo
after her trip in September 1986.

REMUNERATION: 

Sums paid to her ranged between R50 and R200.

For special operations she received more. For the killing of Viva she got
R800. For passing on information which led to the ambush and killing of
Paul Dikeledi and Cassius Make she got R500; originally she had wanted
R1000.

CASE STUDY 10 

Phillip Masiza CONJWAYO

DOB: 01/08/1933, Gweru, Zimbabwe.
RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS: 75 Malvern Road, Waterfalls, Harare, Zimbabwe.
NATIONALITY: Zimbabwean.
(Remark: this is a summarised version; our interest was only in the other
people Phillip Conjwayo implicates. Therefore other activities of
subject, or tasks he carried out have been omitted.)

Date of report: 07/04/1988 

JOINING THE POLICE FORCE: 

* On 20/12/1952, joined the then BSAP

* On 20/12/1960 transferred uniformed branch to Criminal Investigations
Department (CID).

* In April 1962 was attached to the Special Branch/Security Branch until
he retired on pension in November 1980.

RECRUITMENT (AS A SPY FOR SOUTH AFRICA) AND HANDLING: 

In October 1985 whilst working at Peter Wild Associates, Masasa, Harare,
Conjwayo was approached by one Mary Baker, a South African Intelligence
operative. Enquiries revealed that Mary Baker is possibly also known as
Merry Patrice Mackenzie. She is formerly known as Mrs Richardson.

Conjwayo was shown a photograph of Winston Hart and Peter Berg. He was
asked if he still remembered Hart whom he had worked with before, when he
was a serving member of the Special Branch. After a positive response, he
was told that Hart wanted him to do a job on his behalf. Conjwayo
enquired on the nature of the job and he was told that it involved the
monitoring of the ANC(SA) President, O.R. Tambo and Chris Hani whenever
they visited Zimbabwe. Conjwayo refused to co-operate initially.

During the September 1986 visit by Mary Baker, Conjwayo finally agreed to
Hart's previous propositions thereby agreeing to work for the South
African intelligence against the ANC in Zimbabwe. Baker immediately went
to South Africa where she informed Hart about Conjwayo's submissions.
Nothing was heard from either Baker or Hart until April 1987.

HANDLING AND ACTIVITIES OF CONJWAYO: 

* In April 1987, Baker came to Zimbabwe in the company of a white man
known as Frank Cloute (Cloete?). Cloute was introduced to Conjwayo as
Hart's business partner who was on a business trip. Baker informed
Conjwayo that Hart wanted him to travel to South Africa for a meeting.
Before Baker left, she gave Conjwayo a South African contact number:
79524444 Randburg.

* In June 1987, Conjwayo visited South Africa to fulfil his promises. At
Hilbrow Railway Station, he contacted Baker on the above telephone
number. Baker arrived and soon afterwards Hart also arrived. A short
while later, another white man only identified as Brian arrived, and he
appeared to be senior to Hart. Conjwayo's tasks were repeated to him. His
monthly salary was outlined as $450 plus $100 vehicle allowance; plus
vehicle to be maintained by Hart and tyres supplied whenever Conjwayo
visited South Africa. Was to be paid through Baker in Zimbabwe.

* Sometime in September 1987, Conjwayo was phoned by Mary Baker from
South Africa and he was instructed to go and wait for a call from John of
the Innez Terrence public call box. John has since been identified as
Christopher John Bawden, aka Kit. Kit instructed Conjwayo to proceed to
number 8 Durban Road and check whether Jeremy Brickhill was staying
there. If he failed to locate him at the above address, he was to proceed
to Grassroots Bookshop in Stanley Avenue, which Brickhill owned.

* Conjwayo after locating the home and work place of Jeremy Brickhill
reported all that to Christopher John Bawden who was booked at the
Holiday Inn in Harare. * A few days before 1987 Christmas holidays,
Conjwayo was contacted by Mary Baker to expect a call from John. This
John has since been identified as Michael Anthony Smith. The message was
that he should look for Jabulani (ANC cadre) and lure him to an RV along
Beatrice Road, from where he would be abducted to South Africa. Conjwayo
tried but failed to lure Jabulani to the RV because he was elusive. The
South Africans had hoped to airlift Jabulani to South Africa using the
aircraft that para-dropped Henry Thompson alongside three consignments of
arms of war at Carlson's farm, Fort Rixon on 27 December, 1987.

* In January 1988 Conjwayo was given $8000 by Henry Thompson to purchase
a vehicle and to look for a driver. After buying a vehicle Conjwayo
proceeded to the Employment Exchange where he secured the services of
Obed Amon Mwanza, a Zambian national as the driver.

* On the 10/01/1988 Conjwayo parked the vehicle at the Bulawayo Sun Hotel
from where it was collected by Christopher John Bawden (Kit) and Michael
Anthony Smith who armed it on the 11/01/1988.

After arming the vehicle they parked it at Kine theatres along Grey
Street from where it was later collected by Mwanza under Conjwayo's
instructions. Mwanza was told to drive the vehicle to Number 16A Jungle
Road, North Trenance on a purported foreign currency deal.

Upon arrival at the house, Mwanza was to hoot three times to signal his
arrival. Mwanza did not know that the car was armed with a bomb. He also
did not know that Chris Bawden and Anthony Smith were following behind up
to the corner of Jungle Road and Hydrang Road. Upon arrival he did as
instructed and then Christopher Bawden, using a remote control device,
detonated the bomb instantly killing Mwanza and injuring six ANC cadres,
one of them seriously.

* Conjwayo was eventually arrested at Number 29 Makwiro Road, Mabvuku, on
15/01/1988 and was immediately conveyed to Bulawayo. Kevin John Woods was
arrested alongside the owner of the garage, Rory Burt Maguire and his
manager, Michael Howard. Through their interrogations, Michael Smith,
Barry Bawden and Guy Bawden were arrested. Kevin John Woods is a former
member of the CIO and one of the arrested Zimbabwe based South African
sabotage and spying operatives.

3 weeks of anti- African National Congress and anti-communist propaganda
politics for 3 weeks. Covering topics such as anti-Sovietism,distorted
Freedom Charter, invincibility of the racist regime, causes of the Maseru
massacre, and the Ethiopian starvation. He was taught by Van der Merwe,
Botha and Van Vuuren who were sharing topics. He was learning with 20
other people (he doesn't know their names.)

MISSIONS INSIDE: 

In February 1986 he was given a mission to attend the funeral of a cadre
of Umkhonto weSizwe by the name of Thandoxolo Mbethe, to:

Look at people who are armed;
Check on who will be delivering speeches;
Look at those who necklace others;
Spy on all secret meetings of Port-Elizabeth Youth Congress

In April 1986 the subject was moving with the racist police and
vigilantes. He shot a girl in the chest while the Bedford car they
weretravelling in was moving at a very high speed.

Managed to photograph a group of comrades burning a bus. A group of
comrades holding meeting at a shop known as Kwa-Vantjie.

On leaving the country the subject was given the description of his
contact as Vusi who wears a red earing on the left ear and black soleless
shoes Given R450.00 to use for travelling.

MISSIONS OUTSIDE: 

To poison food;
Sabotage property of the organisation;
To get names, description, and places of origin in South Africa of camp
commanders and instructors;
To memorise residences of the organisation in the front line states.

Material given for fulfilling them:
A yellow powder, in a container.

Route to leave South Africa:
He was told that Vusi had addresses of contacts in all the front line
states including Zaire.

In May 1986 he mobilised a friend by the name of Mzimkhulu to leave the
country. they got a lift from Port-Elizabeth to Johannesburg, and found
their way to Meadowlands to a person called Tirewo of Zone 9. Tirewo took
them to his relative Kenneth Ngwedzeni of Zone 8 where they stayed for
two months.

From there they left for Botswana, On arrival in Botswana they were taken
to Dukwe transit camp were he met Vusi talked about their missions Vusi
went to an extend of showing him the list of addresses he had with him.
They last saw each other in Zambia.

MISSIONS FULFILLED: 

Whilst in Zambia Mthobile claims to have poured the poison given to him
into the soft porridge when he was on duty on September 16 1986 in
Cherlston transit camp in Lusaka. He says he only poured in half of it.
Because he was afraid, he claims to have taken some of the poison in a
glass of water and drank it, trying to commit suicide, the reason being
he was afraid to account for the mess. About 40 people were rushed to the
Hospital with severe diarrhoea. Other comrades were discharged from
hospital, leaving him behind at the hospital.

REPORT DATE: 1988.

CASE STUDY 12 

NAME: LESLIE JOHANNES LESIA 

INTRODUCTION: 

Subject had been in contact with the Movement since 1986. On 15th May
1987 subject was sent by the Maputo cdes to be investigated in Lusaka
because he was linked to a bomb explosion which took place in Harare on
12/05/87 in comrade Mhlophe's residence resulting in the death of his
wife. (Cde Mhlophe is a former ANC Chief Representative in Mozambique).

In Lusaka subject confessed the following:-

CONTACT WITH ANC: 

In around August or Septmebr 1986, a comrade named Victor Ephraim Tebogo
Lesia passed away in Tanzania as a result of a car accident. The late
comrade's family was informed and the mother came to Maputo accompanied
by the subject, who claimed he was Victor's uncle, and proceeded to
Tanzania. It was during this period that subject got acquainted with our
comrades in Maputo and struck up a close relationship with Cde Mhlophe
(former Chief Representative in Mozambique) and Herbert (Chief Rep. in
1987).

Subject had also been visiting Lesotho where he knew cdes Ngalitye and
Herbert. On the family's return to South Africa they were contacted by
the Security Branch enquiring on their trip to Tanzania.

CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO RECRUITMENT: 

In 1985 subject claims to have formed a project which he called Leslie's
Performing Arts and Cultural Institution. He applied to various foreign
companies for sponsorship. The American Embassy in Pretoria responded and
sent him forms to fill in.

In October 1986 (after the trip to Tanzania) the application was approved
and he received a grant of R15 000 to purchase equipments. A Mr Hutchison
from the American embassy met the subject to start the project. A short
while later, a Mr Brown and Ernest Becker were introduced to him at the
American embassy in Pretoria. He was told about a white organisation
called the Orange Free State Art Foundation and was advised to make
contact with its members and subsequently join.

At some point Mr Hutchison flew to Bloemfontein to meet subject and
introduced to him a Mr Cooper, a lawyer to handle the financial side of
the project.

RECRUITMENT: 

Subject was recruited by Mr Brown and Becker to gather information on the
ANC in Maputo.

MISSIONS ASSIGNED AND  FULFILLED: 

During the period of October 1986 to May 1987 subject made about five (5)
trips to Maputo from Bloemfontein as per instructions from his handlers,
Brown and Becker in Pretoria. In general his missions were to establish:

+ the number of ANC members in Maputo
+ identities of ANC members
+ whether ANC members expelled by the Mozambican government had left.
+ whether cdes Joe Slovo and Sue Rabkin were in Mozambique.

PAYMENTS: Subject claims that for his first mission he received a sum of
R2 000; for the second mission he received R1 000; he was not paid for
the third trip, because he did not report to his handlers about secretly
taking his son, David Makhaya Lesia, to join the ANC in Maputo. For the
fourth mission he was paid R800, and for the fifth, R2 000

LEGEND (TO THE ANC): 

++ He wanted to do underground work and he claimed to have already formed
underground structures. He needed trained cadres and materials to carry
plans to eliminate enemy personnel.
++ Another one given by his handlers was to establish business contacts
in Maputo for purchasing prawns and ivory.

Subject's account of the bomb which killed the wife of Cde. Mhlope:
Cde Mhlophe had asked the subject to obtain a colour television for him.
The subject mentioned this to his controllers and asked them whether they
could get one at a discount. The handlers agreed. During April cde
Mhlophe was in Maputo for cde Gibson's funeral. Mhlophe phoned the
subject who informed him that he got the television and would bring it to
Maputo.

Subject then contacted his handlers in Pretoria who gave him the
television. They told him that there were certain wires which were part
of the packing material, and had to be removed to operate the remote
controls. The subject went to Maputo and delivered the television to cde
Mhlophe.

APPENDIX EIGHT



Behind South Africa's Low Intensity War


Despite all the peace initiatives of the churches and human rights
organisations, despite all the peace accord, despite all the exposures
and revelations about the involvement of the security forces in the
conflict, the violence continues. Why? 

JEFF MARISHANE has been studying this kind of violence in South Africa
and in other parts of the world. The killings are not as senseless as
they appear to be. Viewed against the background of what the military
strategists around the world call LIC (Low Intensity Conflict), South
Africa's violence makes complete sense-rather frightening sense. 

We publish a brief summary of Jeff's research.

The violence in South Africa today is a classic example of what the
military strategists call Low Intensity Warfare (LIW). This
counter-insurgency strategy has a long history in South Africa and other
parts of the world. Some acquaintance with this history will help us to
understand the reasoning behind the violence.

AFTER VIETNAM 

Their humiliating defeat in Vietnam finally convinced the United State
military strategies and politicians that guerilla wars, insurrections and
revolutions cannot be defeated by conventional armies using conventional
military strategies. The mightiest army in the world with well trained
personnel, sophisticated weapons, endless bombardment, wholesale
massacres, torture and even the notorious napalm bomb could not defeat
the Vietnamese insurgents.

Will and determination were on the side of the Vietnamese who kept coming
back despite the merciless war of attrition conducted against them. Not
only did the US Army lose the minds and hearts of the Vietnamese, they
almost lost the minds and hearts of their own citizens.

It was obvious that from the perspective of US military interests that
new and imaginative strategies of counter-insurgency would have to be
found. Low Intensity Conflict was born out of this search for
alternatives, although many of the elements of the new military strategy
had been formulated earlier.

THE AIM OF LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT IS NOT A MILITARY VICTORY BY
DESTABILISATION. 

HEART AND MINDS 

In 1952, when General Sir Gerald Templar, the British Military High
Commissioner in Malaya, was asked whether he had enough troops to defeat
the insurgents in this British colony, he replied: "The answer lies not
in pouring more soldiers into the jungle, but in the hearts and minds of
the Malayan People".

In the USA, even before the Vietnam war, the CIA (Central Intelligence
Agency) had begun to develop this "hearts and minds"strategy in their
covert operations.

Edward G. Lonsdale, a former advertising executive, was sent to the
Philippines as a CIA operative in the fifties to destroy the Huk
rebellion by winning the hearts and minds of the people.

He did this by planting informers, recruiting defectors, spreading
disinformation and by numerous other "dirty tricks". But most of all he
constructed a political alternative in the person of Ramon Magsaysay, a
friendly, popular man performs, for peace and for elections. Like F.W. de
Klerk?

In the fifties in the Philippines this formula worked. After the Vietnam
fiasco this was the formula for counter-insurgency around the world - it
was even used a second time in the Philippines when Marcos, the new
dictator, lost the minds and hearts of the people.

This approach came to be known as Low Intensity Conflict. It was further
developed over the years and its tactics became more and more sinister
and violent.

TOTAL WAR 

In the days of P.W. Botha we heard a lot about the total onslaught that
required a total strategy on the part of the State. The idea and the
words came from General Andre Beaufre's book, "An Introduction to
Strategy" (Faber 1963) which was based upon his experience of
counter-insurgency as a French general in Algeria.

Basically total strategy or total was means "anything goes" - any kind of
dirty trick or deception or even terrorism. The argument is that we can
only defeat "the enemy" by adopting the methods and strategies they use.
Their total onslaught requires a total response. If they lie, we lie; if
they kill, we kill; if they plant bombs, we plant bombs; if they
destabilise communities we do the same.

The perception of what any particular liberation movement is trying to do
may be wrong, but LIC is thought of as giving terrorists a dose of their
own medicine with disinformation, sabotage, death squads, hitmen,
assassinations, planting bombs in buildings, killing civilians and
generally destabilising communities.

The US Army has defined LIC as " a limited political military struggle
(which) ranges form diplomatic, economic and psychological pressure
through terrorism and insurgency". A former commander of US Special
Operations in EI Salvador describes LIC as "total war at the grassroots
level"

High Intensity Warfare means a nuclear war. Mid-intensity Warfare means a
war with conventional weapons like the war against Iraq. Low Intensity
Warfare uses unconventional methods against any kind of "communist" or
"terrorist" threat.

DESTABILISATION 

LIC is anti-communist. It is a way of destabilising revolutionary
movement which are thought to be communist and a way of destabilising
governments that have been taken over by communists. In the late started
low intensity wars against the new Marxist governments in Angola,
Mozambique, Nicaragua and Afghanistan. They trained, armed and supported
right-wing guerrilla groups in each country to do the work of
destabilisation: Unita in Angola, Renamo or MNR in Mozambique, the
Contras in Nicaragua and the Mudjahedin in Afghanistan.

Two very important lessons were learnt from this exercise in Low
Intensity Warfare. The first was that the aim of LIC should not be a
military victory but destabilisation. Once the country had been
thoroughly destabilised and the economy in ruins, the long suffering and
war-weary people would quite happy to vote for a pro-Western government
in a general election. This happened a short while ago in Nicaragua.

Counter-revolutionary terrorism is far more effective than any amount of
propaganda as a way of getting people to vote for peace, reform and
moderation.

The second lesson the strategists learnt was that you must use puppets or
surrogate armies. You must not introduce a foreign army of occupation.
You must no introduce a foreign army of occupation. You must get the
people of the same nation to fight the government you want to
destabilise. Angolans must fight Mozambicans.

The lessons of the Vietnam war are now clear: don't try to win the war,
just your own troops, get the "native" to fight one another.

DIVINE AND RULE 

Finally, LIC terrorism had now become the most effective way of keeping a
pro-Western government in power. In countries like Guatemala, EI
Salvador, the Philippines and South Africa, LIC is a kind of divide and
rule strategy that prevents and effective revolution form the left. Every
possible means is used to get the poor to begin fighting one another.
This demotivated and confused to organise a liberation struggle against
the government. It then becomes possible for the government to pose as
the neutral peacemaker.

A variety of means are now being used to instigate internal conflict:
vigilantes, gangsters, death squads, agents provocateurs, recruiting
mercenaries form the unemployed, exploiting political rivalries and
tribal loyalties.

Today the most sophisticated use of LIC to destabilise the left and the
communities that might support them is being planned and executed in
South Africa.

LIC IN SOUTH AFRICA 

South Africa's military strategists are very well versed in the theory
and techniques of LIC. Many of our generals, including Magnus Malan,
studied counter-insurgency in the military academies of the USA. Their
links with other military strategists from Chile to Israel are well known.

The generals and the politicians have not only made use of the theory of
total strategy and dirty tricks and winning hearts and minds, but they
have also gained much experience in the use of death squads, as we learnt
from the Harms Commission and numerous other revelations, and in the
"art" of destabilising other countries by means of hit squads or
surrogate forces like Renamo, Unita and the Lesotho Liberation Army.

By 1989 it had become abundantly clear that these strategies were not
working. More subtle forms of counter-insurgency would have to be worked
out.

At the beginning of 1990, the new plan began to emerge: abandon the
policy of apartheid, unban the opposition, present the National Party as
a moderate, reformist party working for peace, improve the image of white
South Africa and stop sanctions. But what if the black majority took
advantage of the new freedom to rise up and take power? Whether that is
likely to happen or not, it represents what whites fear most.

Addressing these fears on March 8. 1992, during the white referendum
debate on TV, Hernus Kriel, the Minister of Law and Order, pointed our
that since February 2, 1990 the violence has changed from "black on
white" to "black on black". Does that mean that there was deliberate
strategy not only to stop the ANC's armed struggle, but also to
destabilise the black community by instigating internal conflict?

BEHIND THE VIOLENCE 

The pattern of violence since the beginning of the 90's is clear. In
ICT's booklet on violence, "The New Kairos" published in September 1990,
a clear distinction is made between "the causes of the violence and the
conditions that make violence possible."

The conditions that are being exploited include political rivalry,
tribalism, hostel dwellers and residents, squatters and residents and
competing taxi associations. But the instigators of the violence are a
"third force" that most commentators and analysts now trace back to the
Special Forces of the SADF. Nobody else could orchestrate conflict
throughout the country on such a massive scale without being discovered.
The operation is now so extensive and so complicated, employing thousands
of highly skilled people, planning hundreds of attacks and conspiracies,
using vast amounts that it is not longer possible to monitor the
operation, left alone stop it.

What still puzzles many commentators, however , is the motive. Are they
trying to wreck the negotiations process? Acquaintance with the long
history of low intensity conflict as strategy shows that the violence is
meant to complement the government's negotiation policy by demotivating
demoralising, destabilising and confusing the war-weary people of the
township who are then supposed to opt for peace at all costs as they did
in Nicaragua, Angola and Mozambique. It has all been very carefully
thought out to confuse and frighten everyone.

On February 2, 1990, the security establishment did not abandon the low
intensity war that they had been waging against the people for years.
They simply adapted it. Sergeant Felix Ndimene claims that his SADF
superiors described the new mission of the Special Forces as "a different
kind of war". The same people are now busy with a more extensive, more
invisible and more destructive war against the people

APPENDIX NINE





FOR THE SAKE
OF OUR LIVES!

Guidelines for the creation of peoples self-defence units





1. Introduction


1.1 In the wake of the ugly violence unless against our people by
security forces, vigilante groups and hit-squads it is imperative that
our liberation movement takes responsibility for guiding and building
people's self-defence units.


In the past our attempts to defend ourselves have been spontaneous and
sometimes poorly planned, and lacking in discipline.

What we need is an organised and disciplined force, guided by political
leadership, which will serve both to protect the community and ensure law
and order.


1.2 This task is urgent and should be given top priority by the ANC and
our allies.


The minister onslaught on our movement and on the people is an attempt by
the regime to divide our people, weaken our movement and sow suspicion
and confusion. Failure to find ways of protecting our people will
inevitably lead to a loss of confidence in the ANC and liberation
movement. There is also the danger of widespread demoralisation among the
masses if no solution is found.

One of the aims of the reactionary forces is precisely to intimidate the
masses and eliminate leading activist.


1.3 A political solution to this problem must be sought.


Initiative such as the talks with Inkatha are extremely important.
Campaigns at local and trade union levels to improve understanding
between township communities and hostel dwellers are imperative.

Political pressure on the regime, side by side with well-documented
exposure of the role of the security forces, and mass protests throughout
the country, are means through which we can force the government to curb
the killers.

But side-by-side with these political endeavour, we must build
organisational structures that can protect the lives and homes of the
people.

The building of strong ANC and SACP branches, trade unions, civic
associations, youth and women's organisations and street committees are
the foundation of our people's unity and power.

No matter how strongly we develop these democratic structures, however,
in the current climate of violent assault we need to establish
specialised, broadly-based people's self-defence structures.

These should embrace all our people's political, social and cultural
organisations irrespective of ideological differences and political
affiliation.

In other words defence units should not be affiliated to any political
party or movement by the a protective force which serves the community as
a whole.


1.4 We need a two-pronged strategy:

* a political offensive for peace an unity among the people based on
  strong political organisations; and
* self-defence structures to protect our people.

1.5 Self-defence structures need, by definition, to be para-military.
They differ from all the other forms of organisations referred to,
including street committees.


They must be tightly structured to repulse aggression an ensure law and
order, they need a specific command and control system; their members
must be trained and have a high degree of discipline.


1.6 At present, in the light of the Groote Schuur and Pretoria Minutes,
Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) alone cannot undertake the task of our people's
defence, although this is a right we need to forcefully demand and
struggle for.


The August 6 cease-fire does not neutralise MK.

It has an important role to play. MK cadres, particularly ex-prisoners
and those due to return from exile, must play a leading and active role
in the establishment of the defence.


1.7 As we proceed to establish defence units so we must raise the demand
for the right of self-protection.


Government Ministers, including De Klerk an Vlok allow the Inkatha bands
to carry so-called "cultural" weapons.

What is more they allow the AWB to organise military training camps and
concede to them the right of "self protection" as long as in Vlok's words
their commandos "do not attack anyone".

Our people, who are overwhelmingly the victims of aggression, must demand
the right of self-protection too! It is a demand the regime will find
extremely difficult to deny and by pressing energetically ahead with a
programme of establishing defence units we will make it impossible for
the authorises to prevent their growth.


1.8 Our people have the moral right to state: "We do not intend to attack
anybody by we demand the right to protect our lives, our lives, our
families, our homes and communities! We are forced to create defence
units for the sake of our lives".


Clearly we cannot rely on the apartheid police and army for protection.

When they are not attacking the people they are encouraging, siding with
and arming the ultra-right forces, warlords and vigilantes.

The impression is also very strong that the sinister hit-squads are
recruited form their ranks.

If we are to protect our lives then we must rely on our own strength,
organisations and resources.


1.9 Our strength is in our numbers but it must be organised strength.


A group of 200 armed thugs cannot possibly overcome a township of 20 000
if the people are prepared united and determined.


1.10 In the past there were some examples of township or shanty-town
inhabitants setting up loosely formed defence units.


These often degenerated into sectarian or personal power-bases and
sometimes were used as a cover for criminal activities.

To guard against this defence units must have firm political direction
and be rooted amongst the communities they serve.


1. 11 Considerable experience has acquired from township an rural
resistance. This must be utilised to develop the best way of organising
defence structures.


We need to collect such contributions, organise group discussions, and
work-shops etc. to learn and generalise from the practical experience.

This booklet is a contribution to ongoing discussions.

Theory must grow out of practise and in turn guide practise.


1.12 In forming defence structures there are various elements and tasks
we will have to tackle


o Among these are:
  - Organisations
  - Structure
  - Street defence system
  - Recruitment
  - Training
  - Weapons
  - Communications
  - Intelligence
  - Observation
  - Barricades & fortifications
  - Auxiliaries (support group)
  - Work with hostile forces
  - Tactics an the operational plan




2. Organisations


2.1 The creation of a defence system for a township, shanty town, rural
district or other such area should first be discussed with local
organisations.


Involved in these consultations should be ANC and SACP branches, civic
associations, local trade union structures, women and youth groups, an
other formations irrespective of ideological or political affiliation.

As broad a spectrum of groupings as possible should be involved.

There should be no intention of setting the defence units up as "armies"
of any political groupings or individuals.

This is undesirable and potentially dangerous - it is prescription for
"Libanonising" a conflict.

The defence units are created for the purpose of protecting the
community. But this does not mean that the ANC and its allies should not
initiate and guide the process.


2.2 Having agreed on a common approach the local organisations should
next approach the community at large in order to explain the need for a
local defence system and ensure their understanding and acceptance.


Time and attention must be given to this important process.

It is pointless to proceed unless the people are fully behind the idea.

2.3 Once agreement has been reached by the community, local organisations
should appoint or elect a defence committee. It is probably preferable
that the committee should be appointed because popular individuals do not
necessarily make the best commanders but such appointments should arise
out of careful consultation. The committee should be composed of reliable
and decisive people who have the ability to organise and command without
being dictatorial. Comrades with military skills, such as MK cadres or
reliable ex-policemen, could be likely candidates for key positions.


2.4 The committee and the entire self-defence structure serves the
community and the people's organisations and is subservient to them.


This principle must be made perfectly clear to all members of the
self-defence structures and to the people.


2.5 Whether the committee is appointed or elected, the popular
organisations should have the right to replace anyone on the committee
who proves to be unsatisfactory or even to replace the entire committee
if need be.

2.6 But when the community is under attack or in danger, all must obey
the defence committee's orders.


This is not the time to attempt to replace members of the committee: that
must be done before the danger arises, or after it is over.



3. Structure



3. Township Defence Force (TDF)


To begin with we should concentrate on creating defence structures at the
township level. This will give us a chance to test and experiment with
the appropriate structures.


This booklet will concentrate on a model for a Township Defence Force
(TDF).

(We will need to elaborate models for both urban and rural localities,
for squatter camps and possibly for industrial zones. There is the need
for defence structures on mine compounds. NUM have established these at
some mine hostels and important lessons have been learnt. There is also
the need to elaborate some form of protection on the trains, at taxi
ranks and in city centres where a system of patrolling is required).

For the purpose of this booklet we will elaborate a structure for an
urban township taking a population size of 20 000 inhabitants as our
demonstration model.



3.2 Township defence committee(TDC)


The TDC must be headed by a commander who works with a deputy (second in
commander or 2iC) and about eight others.


These head the various defence formations and structures.

On the committee will be the company commanders plus those responsible
for the various specialist responsibilities: chiefs of communications;
intelligence; political instructions; ordinance/Logistics(for
organisations of weapons and materials).

Other portfolio could be medical and Engineering (construction of
barricades/ defence works).

The TDC must have a permanent headquarters (HQ) - with alternative
workplace for reason of security.

Security must be promised to ensure the safety of the TDC and its HQ.

For this purpose a security section under the TDC's deputy commander
should be created.

The TDC must be linked to all subordinate structures by an efficient and
reliable means of communications.



3.3 Company formations


Immediately under the defence committee are the company formations.


These should be organise along para-military lines and are probably the
most manageable units for the defence of a township of about 20 000
inhabitants.

Because of the defensive aspect of the tasks and para-military nature of
the structures the company and subordinate formations will be larger than
found in a regular army.

Each company could consist of about 500 volunteers.

Four companies totalling 2 000 volunteers would make up the full complete
of the TDF.

Each company would be under the charge of a company commander and deputy
company commander.

(It will take time for the companies to reach full strength. The numbers
is involved will depend on the success of the recruitment drive. It might
be necessary to first build one company and then proceed to develop
additional ones.

Alternatively companies could be started simultaneously and gradually
built to full strength.

The strength of platoons and sections, referred to below, will therefore
depend on the success of recruitment.

If there are not enough recruits then the figures suggested could be
halved without interfering with the structural arrangement).



3.4 Platoons


A platoon would consist of 100 volunteers, under a platoon commander and
deputy.


Five platoons make up a company.



3.5 Sections


A section would consist of 20 volunteers, under a section leader and
deputy. Five sections make up a platoon. The section is the basic unit of
the defence force.


4. Street defence systems


4.1 There are a variety of ways in which the township could be defended.


The most rational system would be to give each unit a specific area of
responsibility which it would protect with the co-operation of eh
residents of that area. Such a system could be referred to as a "street
defence system".

Units could move out of their allotted defence sectors and take up
different positions if need be. This would depend on tactical
considerations.

At present we will simply outline the basic defence sectors of the units.


4.2 Each section is responsible for the defence of a single street from
one intersection to the next.

4.3 Five sections (one platoon) defend a block of five streets.

4.4 Five platoons (one company) defend a block of 25 streets.

4.5 Four companies should cover the entire township. If this is too
small, additional companies can be established.

4.6 During the period before full strength has been achieved on section
could be responsible for defending two or more streets.

4.7 The residents of the respective streets fall under the protection of
the appropriate sections.


They will be organised on voluntary basis in an auxiliary or support
capacity for the defence of their street and homes and to render
assistance to the section.

This support should be organised with the assistance of the street
committees where these exist or through the popular organisations.

Every inhabitant, young and old, has a role to play and should be
organised.
(For the tasks of these auxiliary forces see section 12)



5 Recruitment


5.1 Joining the defence force must be on a voluntary basis.


A lively and active recruitment drive must be launched to popularise the
need for joining up.

As the first units are formed and begin to train and drill in uniform
much excitement and enthusiasms will be generated and the ground well to
join will increase.

Membership should be open to able-bodied adults, both men and women. The
community must set a minimum age-limit - probably 18 or 16. Youth under
the age-limit and others of all ages can be deployed in the auxiliary
forces.


5.2 Volunteers must be carefully selected. Criminals and other unreliable
element must be excluded until they prove their reliability.

5.3 Would - be recruits must be screened and checked by the street
committees and popular organisations to prevent infiltration by
impimpi's. If no street committees exist, a system of neighbourhood
checking must be instituted.


Comrades trained with in the ANC 's security organ should help set up
this screening system.


5.4 Recruits must accept the requirements of discipline and readiness to
obey orders. They must be prepared to undergo physical and other
training. They must be ready to give their time and service and
understand the need for punctuality. Above all they must understand the
need for punctuality. Above all they must understand that they are
serving the community.


The wearing of uniforms, drilling in formation and political education
will build the required discipline and morale.


5.5 Those who display the best qualities appointed to leadership
positions.


6. Training


6.1 There will need to be a basic training programme for all volunteers
and a specialised training programme for commanders and those dealing
with specialised tasks such as communications, intelligence etc.


Instructors will need to be appointed and in most cases given some
training guides and assistance. Commanders and deputies from section,
platoon and company levels will need to be given some initial training
slightly in advance of their units so they in turn can act as instructors.



6.2 Physical Fitness


Volunteers need to be physically fit. Light physical training is best
conducted at the section level.


Time will be a constraint, however, especially for those going off to
work early and return home late. Where possible the section should
exercise as a unit.

Ten minutes light exercise followed by a twenty-minute daily jog is
sufficient.

If the section can only exercise together on the weekend then individuals
should be encouraged to exercise on their own on a daily basis.

The joint weekend run can be increased to 30 minutes and is strongly
recommended.

As well as developing strength and stamina the joint run (or toi-toi)
will develop a collective spirit.

A longer run is not recommended because time on the weekends will be
needed for other training and activity.



6.3 Unarmed Self-Defence


The joining of martial arts classes like karate should be encouraged.


Those with such skills should be utilised to teach the basic exercises to
the others ("each one teach one").


6.4 Drilling time on weekend should be allotted to marching and drilling
information from section to platoon and finally to company level.


Units will have to trained to speedily assemble ("fall in") and to
rapidly move in formation from one point to another. They must become
used to rapid "on the double" movement.

Drilling is the basis of organised and disciplined manoueuverability. It
is also the way of conditioning the volunteers to respond to commands as
formation.

The units must be trained to immediately respond to various signals and
alarms. The use of whistles should be used to convey certain commands.

For example three blasts of whistle could be the order for a section to
assemble at a particular point their street.

There needs to be a signal that commands the sections to assemble in
their platoon formations and an other which brings the entire company
together at a particular assembly point.

There need to be commands which order sections to take up defence
positions in their streets and others which speedily bring the platoons
and even companies to specific points of impending attack.

There need to be signals for advance and retreat and of course an alarm
which mobilises the entire township into a state of battle readiness.

All these signals and manoeuvre must be practised until perfection is
achieved.



6.5 Political Instruction


At least one evening class should be conducted every week. Initial
lectures should deal with the reasons for self-defence and the role of
the TDF.


They syllabus should deal with the national liberation struggle, the
current political situation, strategy and tactics etc.



6.6 Weaponry

Firearms

A political campaign will have to be waged for the arming of the
self-defence units.

All avenues need to be explored, including the setting up of licensed
security organisations.

Licensed weapons van be obtained.
Funds will have to be collected on a voluntary basis from the community.

Once even a few firearms have been obtained firearms training can begin.
This should be handled by MK cadres and sympathetic township police.

For initial training purpose airguns should be used. Air rifles and
pistols (the pellet gun type) can be bought for about R200 each.

The advantages is that no license is required and they are not excellent,
cheap and safe way for teaching people how to aim and shoot correctly.

A suitable practise ranges needs to be organised.

Rudimentary weapons

While everything must be done to adequately arm the defence units we
should not scorn the use of rudimentary weapons.


From early times people have used clubs and stones, catapults and spears
for hunting and self-defence.

The martial arts illustrate how formidable simple weapons can be.

A history of township and rural resistance simple weapons can be.

The material arts illustrate how formidable simple weapons can be.

A history of township and rural resistance shows that rudimentary weapon
can be effectively used.

The Vietnamese peasants used rudimentary weapons extremely effectively
against the might American invaders (for example traps of sharpened
bamboo, spikes etc).

In countries like EI Salvador and Nicaragua home-made weapons have been
used on a mass scale in the struggle against dictatorship (e.g. petrol
bombs, homemade handgrenades, dynamite).

Our people must be encouraged to make homemade weaponry purely for
defensive purpose.

We need to face the fact that it is going to be a problem to obtain the
necessary firearms. Until we do, we will simply have to make do with
homemade weaponry.

In a country like South Africa, however, there are plenty of
sophisticated means of protection that can be legally purchased among
them gas guns and sprays. Cross bows and bow-and-arrow sets can also be
bought without a licence.

Factory and engineering workers have the skills and the equipment to
manufacture rudimentary weapons.

Volunteers who do no, have firearms should at least be quipped with two
stout sticks, clubs or iron bars and a homemade shield.

With training these can be utilised in a formidable way for self-defence
against assailants armed with rudimentary weapons.

A section or platoon of determined volunteers, acting in unison, can
offer stiff resistance.

Would-be aggressors will think twice before advancing on a company of 500
trained volunteers beating their shields with the sticks and displaying a
militant attitude.

In fact in many countries this is how the police are equipped for riot
control.

Neither should we scorn the use of missiles such as stones. We have seen
how stone throwers can put even the police to flight. A platoon or
section of volunteers throwing stones on command and in unison can
disrupt and put to flight a hostile attacking force.

If a few armed volunteers are informed by units hurling stones and other
missiles, such as petrol bombs, a very strong defence can be put up.

This means that training should be conducted to improve the throwing
ability of the volunteers.

The auxiliary forces, township youth etc. need to be given such training
as well.

In this way any hostile force can be met by a sustainable hail of
missiles which will make it impossible for them to advance and can
actually put them to flight.

The auxiliary forces can be given the task manufacturing home-made
weapons and stockpiling reserves of missiles.

Work and storage place need to be organised for this purpose and the
weapons safely hidden.

The ordinance/logistics chief is responsible for the acquisition,
manufacture and safe storage of all weapons and material. For this
purpose he will need a small staff of assistants. They will issues
instructions to all units and auxiliaries in this respect.

We can make up for our shortage of firearms by the well organised use or
rudimentary weapons. When these are used by highly manoueverable battle
formation and groups, following well prepared plans and employment
flexible tactics, utilising a barricades system and other fortifications
and reinforced by the whole population acting as and auxiliary force, the
township acting as an auxiliary force, the township will be turned into a
hornet's nest for the aggressor.

As the defence units become better equipped with modern firearms so their
defence capacity will be increased. The prior used of rudimentary weapons
will have served as useful training and practise apart from their defence
capacity.



6.7 Training Time-Table


A time-table for training might look like this:

* Physical Fitness - 3-0 minutes first thing every morning plus a
  longer group run on weekends;
* Political - evening class once a week;
* Drilling - two to three hours on the weekend;
* Firearms - one to two hours on the weekend; Classes should not be too
  large and are therefore best conducted at section level ( that is for
  20 volunteers).
