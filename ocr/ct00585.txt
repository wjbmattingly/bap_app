is controlled by the residents - there is no other work I do.

ADV POTGIETER:

The story you want to tell us relates to 1985 at a time when you were

MR FATYELA:

Thatís true.

ADV POTGIETER:

And can you tell us what happened when you were arrested at - by the
police and taken away?



MR FATYELA:

Thank you sir, at Sabello school we had a meeting together with parents.
We were the SRC, our parents who were there at the location. We had this
discussion that was to be in town and these parents were no going be
there and this discussion was going to be in town, so we were still
discussing where - which day we should go to the white school and talk
about certain matters of Ixaya because Ixaya was backward there - there
were no facilities and people were not helping.

So whilst we were there parents came because they had been called by the
teachers because there were 3 teachers that were not wanted there - 2 of
these still teach there in Richmond but one is not teaching. Whilst we
were still talking policemen came into our school.

Firstly they wanted to find out what we were busy with as student, then
we said no these - this is a problem that was effecting our parents and
us only. Then we got an instruction from one of the teachers who was
present there at the time - this was a teacher by the name Zongezile
Mtona and he said the police were looking for 3 teachers because they
were the teachers who were teaching politics in that school.

This does not matter, there at school they asked to get inside, then we
answered as the SRC - we said no they were not allowed to come in because
we were holding a meeting. And the one who gave that answer is Alfred
that Iím going to mention earlier - later on. Then they said they were
not only talking to him but even to other students as well. I was angry
and I was for it that they should not come in. Then they asked that we
should shift this venue for the meeting, then we refused because we did
not have transport to get to town.

Then they hired a car belonging to the late Galolo which was a blue Kombi
- some of us - of the students got into this Kombi and they were waiting
outside - of these students were taken to Stadssaal - City Hall - where
you were going to have this meeting. 12 of us could not get transport and
some of the members remained behind, so we walked to the place but on our
way next to the coloured - in the coloured area next to a shop owned by
Mvengo - and next to this shop there was a clinic - we stood just between
the clinic and the shop and we saw a blue car - Mazda car stopping there
- it was stopped - parked at the clinic.

And next to it was a Special Branch who - policemen who had a shambok
with him. He shouted as we were coming, inviting us to come close to him
- he was a coloured man - and he was saying it in Afrikaans that we
should all come to him and I became doubtful as I came nearer the clinic.
I bent down as if I was getting ready to run away because I didnít know
why he was calling us and he was even shaking this shambok. And I even
told the others that I was going to run away. Then he could see what my
intentions were and he said Iím looking at you even if you were to run
away Iím going to shoot at you and he showed me the gun.

Then I decided to dismiss this idea and follow the others - so I followed
the others and went to him into the clinic. This Mazda was parked
somewhere and then he asked us to stand in a line - you could see they
were unfriendly. We stood there in a line, they looked at our faces and
one of them took a walkie-talkie whilst - and ask for a van and whilst we
were waiting for the van one of us had a sticker reading [indistinct] and
this Special Branch took - asked who is this dog and where do you know
this dog from and the other one said this is Matthews Sgoniwe and then he
asked how is he related to you and this one said heís my brother and he
asked where is he then he said he died, so the van come before they could
continue.

Then he directed us into the van - we got into the van hurriedly, they
drove us down to the Police Station and at the Police Station they asked
us to wait behind the counter - they were there with us. Then two
policemen - black policemen, Thabo and Adjutant and others came, they
were Ruiters, Blom, quite a group of policemen. Two black policemen went
out leaving the white policemen with us and instruction was that we
should burn. And he asked who had burnt the clinic and this Special
Branch was standing and listening and he said we were responsible for the
burning and this persons was saying - was Adjutant and they wanted to ask
who was responsible for the burning of the clinic and he called
Boetietjie - who was a - he was of a Genini Kobo family and he responded
and he said you respond and they asked for Koebo and there was no Koebo
amongst us - it was just a slogan that was used in the location to mean
that there was problems.

Now they were asking for Koebo and they hit one of us with a fist and
they said here are the others sitting here, they were kicking us and they
kept on kicking and hitting us. And then he would ask and address
Sinqueua as Matthew Sgoniwe and he would stand up and he would ask: Do
you know this person? Then he would say: No I donít know. And he was
crying at the time because they were hitting him against the wall at the
time. Then he would ask him to sit down and they would call us. I didnít
know where these Special Branch came from, that was me and Windking - and
they would ask where we came from and I was not prepared to speak
Afrikaans because I didnít even know it well.

Then I answered back, I said: No sir we come from the "Kafferland". And
then he said to me I was a stupid and then he asked the other one where
he came from and he said he had come - he was coming from a farm
attending school and he didnít know anything. Then he asked us to sit
down, then he would call on the others that he felt they could beat up
and they took them into different rooms. And then he said they were going
to put these children straight because they donít listen and I didnít
understand why they were going to beat us up because we didnít know
anything. As we were coming out we left those together with Adjutant and
other policemen.

Then Adjutant said to the children they should sing the freedom song that
sings about Thambo but these policemen were making a fool and saying it
is about Thambo. They would hit - hit them against the wall and they were
singing about Thambo, one of them was saying they should be put into a
sack. Then there was a black sack and I was put into it and they asked us
that we should run whilst in a sack and we couldnít see - it was even
suffocating - and we would hit against mirrors. Then they would direct us
which way to run and then you would hit against a mirror, they would say
itís enough and they would even beat you with the batons. They would take
you out and then put someone else and let you lie on you stomach. After a
while they took us back to the cells, I was wishing that the end of the
day should come because they had been hitting us all the way.

Then at the cell we were slightly happy and we chatted to one another. I
was there in one corner in the cell and I was sitting there, I just heard
a noise of opening of keys and they asked - they said donít come and
sleep here, this is Thabo who was saying it. Then I said: Oh, itís a
beating once more. And I was whispering. They asked for Matinda and
Matinda ignored them and he was sleeping. Then they asked for Matinda,
then one pointed at Matinda next to the door. I donít know whether the
interpretation - theyíre going to interpret the insult but they insulted
me about my mother and then they said: Here is Ali-ali who is standing
here.

He was drinking Guava Juice and even poring it on my head and he asked me
to stand up and follow this policeman and he locked the others there. I
went round into a toilet - there was only 3 of us, it was me, Alfred and
the 3rd. And Mongweni said to me: Here is Alfred that you think you are
of the same edge because you donít relate well together. I kept quiet - I
didnít have anything to say. He hit me with the fist and I fell down, he
- another one kicked me and I fell on the other side until Alfred said: I
think we are slow, letís take this person and make this person drink
water from this toilet tub. And then he held me by the waist saying that
I was stubborn and they forced me into the tub - toilet tub. And I
suffocated and he forced me and I tried - they kicked me and he force me
down saying that I was going to stop being stubborn.

They would take me out of the toilet - the others were not aware of all
this and they would make me stand in front of the cell where there was
dirty water with leaves. I would sometimes think of jumping, then I
jumped over and they asked me why I was jumping.

They would take me back and held me with my legs and the other one was
holding me at the back. They forced me into this dirty water, they hit me
with their fists and one said: Lets forgive him. And that was Thabo
saying that. Then they said: Lets take him to show to the other people.
And the cell was full of water, they ask me to sit down and they said
they were not through with him - they were - with me they were coming
back. Adjutant came and his name - Jonk came in and he again beat some
others.

At about 4 oíclock they called us and they asked us to get into one
office and they said: You are not going to insult Mongweni again, you
must leave now. If we were to get you on the way we are going to injure
you and beat - we are going back to the City Hall and if we get someone
there weíre again going to beat that person. So we went out running
followed by the police van and the one who would be at the last would be
beaten. When we got to the coloured location, we saw a group of people
coming - apparently they were coming to take us. So we went to the
location, the people tried to investigate from us whether they had beaten
us and we told everything that - when we told them we were beaten by so
and so, I pause there.

ADV POTGIETER:

Thank you Mr Fatyela, how old were you when you went threw this terrible
experience?

MR FATYELA:

I was 15 years old at the time and I was at home.

ADV POTGIETER:

And for how long have you been in the police custody, how long did this
whole incident last from the time that they took you to the police
station until you were let loose, how long did it take about?

MR FATYELA:

I would say the meeting was to be held at 9 oíclock and at 11 they
arrested us. It was not a very long time but the way we were beaten up it
indicated that if people had not phoned they were still going to continue
to beat us up. I donít know whether Iíve answered your question.

ADV POTGIETER:

Let me ask you was it around - did you say it was around 4 oíclock in the
afternoon when you were eventually released?

MR FATYELA:

Thatís right.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] police custody from about 11 in the morning until about 4
oíclock in the afternoon?

MR FATYELA:

Yes.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] busy beating you up and assaulting you and carrying on as
youíve - as youíve described to us?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, from morning to the afternoon they were doing the same thing to us.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] Alfred and you have referred to Thabo and weíve heard those
two names earlier in testimony as well. Theyíre two police - policemen,
is that correct?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, they are policemen but one is no longer in Richmond. Thereís only -
Alfred there.

ADV POTGIETER:

Were they amongst the perpetrators - amongst the people that assaulted
you?

MR FATYELA:

They are the very people - there were 3 of them together with the Special
Branch that had been brought in by them.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] the third one, you said there were 3 of them together with a
Special Branch - the third one, who was it? It was - one was Alfred, one
was Thabo and who was the third person?

MR FATYELA:

The third was Adjutant Jonk but he was not there outside when all these
things happened but he did all these things right there in the police
station.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] the Station Commander the police - he was in charge of the
police?



MR FATYELA:

Yes, he was in charge and he is the one who started the beating.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] was that person from Richmond or was he from else where?

MR FATYELA:

I wouldnít lie but I donít know where they came from, all I know is that
they were driving in a blue Mazda. Most of the time they were working
together with the Beaufort West people.

ADV POTGIETER:

Do you - have you or any of the other people that were with you, have you
laid any charges against these policemen?

MR FATYELA:

No, there was no time for that as Mr Lolwana stated that if you were to
do any of that you couldnít even consult a doctor, you couldnít go to
Adjutant because he was the leader who would get into the location and
take who ever he wanted.

ADV POTGIETER:

There was no - there was no sense - what you really saying if I
understand you correctly, there is no - there was no sense in going back
to the same people who assaulted you to lay a charge against that very
same people?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, it happens that after you have been injured by people like them and
they take you bad, Adjutant would tell you that he didnít have time for
that. Then where would you get to because there would be no other place
to get to because all these people who are friends together with doctors.

ADV POTGIETER:

You seemed to have just been picked up and just beaten up for the entire
day for no apparent reason, how did you feel after going through that
experience?

MR FATYELA:

They did all this from school as I mentioned that they alleged that we
had burnt the clinic and they were beating me all the time and in - all
they did to me has effected me and I canít hear properly and if - when
you talk to me it takes time for me to answer and I had to go out of
school because of being beaten up. And when I got class I canít hear and
I fall asleep.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] you were not charged with anything, you were not charged for
having committed any offense, you were just released - you were let loose
- you were - they just told you to go home?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, there was - I was not cruel but according to them they found us
talking and then they just decided to take me because of that. Let me
explain this way, most policemen if you were talking to them the
policemen wouldnít like you to point at them where as they would be doing
the same to you.

And they would begrudge you that if they arrest you they would do
something to you - that is what was happening.





ADV POTGIETER:

Just in conclusion it there - is there anything that you would like to
ask the Commission to pay attention to, to look into for you?

MR FATYELA:

My requests - I have a request - my request is that every time I see him
in our location I feel heís going to do something to me ever if he got to
know that I was here before this Commission heís going to come and ask
me. But if he starts pulling me I would have to retaliate. Now I have a
request to this Commission: there at home - Iím going to say briefly - at
home I have a mother, a sister - whoís not working - there are others who
are married, one is a young man whoís working in a school.

My mother is a pensioner and here Iím just sitting at home, unemployed. I
did try to get a job but I canít get one, I went to Postmansburg to get
work at a mine but I could not work because I donít hear. So I would be
lacking behind so I had to go back home.

Iím doing this part time job at the cr»che and there is just no salary
there. Weíre just helping the residents, it is just at a time where I
just make some drawings then I get that little money for the drawings.

My request is - I am - I had intentions that I would continue as a
musician as Iím talented in that field but I canít sing - I canít hear
properly - I canít sing, I just sing because there is no work here in
Richmond therefor Iím asking that there should be a driver organized for
the cr»che because I can drive but I donít have the Drivers License. How
- what can I do to get Drivers License because my mother cannot take the
little money she has and send me to a Drivers School.

Then after that I will be happy and I would have - bear no grudge for any
one.

ADV POTGIETER:

You said - can I just come back to what appears to me to be a concern
that youíve raised, who are you revering to that might come and ask you
about having been to the Commission here to give evidence?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, I - I was just mentioning this that this particular person Iím
talking about we asked each other there at home - they would ask what
happened and then we would give them information and that particular
person would be satisfied.

Iím talking about a person whoís still begrudging me trying to
investigate what are my intentions against him because I must say thereís
still some begrudging of one another there. Iím now talking about Alfred.

ADV POTGIETER:

Is he a policeman?

MR FATYELA:

Yes.

ADV POTGIETER:

What is his - is Alfred his surname of his first name?

MR FATYELA:

Alfred is his first name and his surname is Mongweni - his full name is
Alfred Mongweni.

ADV POTGIETER:

Is he still a policeman in Richmond?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, he is here - heís still a policeman.

ADV POTGIETER:

[indistinct] just very clearly and in public that the Commission would
obviously take a very serious few if anyone who comes to us and
testifies, tell his or her story is approached and intimidated or acted
against because of that very fact that he or she has approached the
Commission.

We - as I say - would regard that in a very, very, very serious light and
we would obviously act quite swiftly against a person who were to - to
consider doing that or were to do that. So I just like to - to take note
of that and to have that assurance from us.



MR FATYELA:

Thank you.

MS SEROKE:

Mr Fatyela when did you [indistinct] your hearing problem. Was it before
you were arrested or after you were arrested?

MR FATYELA:

This is just recent - in this recent years after I was arrested.

MS SEROKE:

Do you think that itís a result of the beating or is it totally unrelated?



MR FATYELA:

What I think is, it was a result of the beating because I was beaten by a
boxer, Alfred, and he did not just give me one beating - he beat me
several times. I went as far as Std 6.

MS SEROKE:

[indistinct] arrested?

MR FATYELA:

Weíre released and then I went to school to continue with my education
but I decided to stop. There was no High School there.

MS SEROKE:

But youíre still interested in continuing your education?

MR FATYELA:

Yes - no, I think I have a problem though I am interested but I have a
problem now.

MS SEROKE:

Tell us about your problem or is it personal - private? Iím trying to
pursue it your interested in getting some kind of training so that at
leased you can improve your chances of getting a job. Is the problem very
private, you donít want to reveal it here?

MR FATYELA:

If I were to - it is a secret if I were to talk to you in camera I would
tell you about it.

MS SEROKE:

And you say Alfred is still in your community?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, heís still there.

MS SEROKE:

Have you [indistinct]

MR FATYELA:

We had a club in the past years which was called the Masakani Boxing Club
and he was the coach together with someone from DA. Then when this boxing
cart dissolved I never saw him nor talked to him. I donít even see him, I
think he lives in town, there is just a different place where he lives
because he left the location.

MS SEROKE:

What makes you think that he might come after you, after finding out that
youíve testified to the Commission?

MR FATYELA:

There - I donít think that he could do anything, but that was just a
question I had - itís only that I spoke about it.

MS SEROKE:

You would like to meat with Alfred and talk about this, would you?

MR FATYELA:

This is easy - it would be easy for us to meet but it would take time
because theyíre still doing many things there in the location. Even these
weeks it would be very difficult for us to come together and talk.





MS SEROKE:

Are there any tensions in the township because of the presence of these
people who were harassing you and everybody else?

MR FATYELA:

What do you mean - you mean these ...[intervention]

MS SEROKE:

[indistinct] arrest people and - people like Alfred.

MR FATYELA:

No thereís no conflict amongst these incidence. Weíre just staying the
usual way because it used to be politics that caused this conflict. Where
you would bring out the truth and they would - didnít accept it and then
they would decide to destroy you and not to listen to you.

MS SEROKE:

Richard - some people who had testified before you, like Ms Nonight they
made mention of some conflict that makes you unhappy where you live. They
were saying the policemen are responsible for it - was Alfred amongst
those policemen who caused this conflict?

MR FATYELA:

I would say when they went into this location first, Alfred was amongst
them - he was driving in one of the vans. He was with Captain and from
the Police Station and other policemen.

MS SEROKE:

Now because this incident is recent, now is it the reason why you donít
have hope that there is no difference from what it used to be. Could you
please repeat your answer. Now because of this conflict which was
mentioned by people earlier on which has led to that shooting of this
child. You feel that this is the cause why you donít have hope that
Alfred and others may have changed from theyíre intentions that they had
long ago.

MR FATYELA:

I would say it would be very difficult to meat them and be united once
more because they come to our locations, small as it is, and once they
see you or they see a drunk person they arrest that person and then how
would you be charting with such people. If they see you walking up and
about they make a display of people.

MS SEROKE:

Is Jonk still there?

MR FATYELA:

No.

MS SEROKE:

You made mention of a clinic that was burnt, why was it burnt?

MR FATYELA:

I really donít know who burnt it, I donít even know the reason why it was
burnt. It was only the door that was slightly burnt, itís not the whole
building that was burnt.

MS SEROKE:

You mentioned many policemen, Alfred, Thabo and Ruiters and Blom and one
female witness said that in addition to this policemen who were used,
there used to be some reserves who came from the farms. Have you ever
seen such reserves during these incidents that you had, that is that time?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, that is the - true, I could give this as an example: when my father
died on - on - in the location there were De Vries, who is the owner of
Oasis - he was one of the reserves - and one lawyer from our residential
area and many others who were from the farms. These people who had just
been taken to come and help in our - in the beating of us. And those were
supposed to be doing the main job, were hiding behind these people.

MS SEROKE:

And these reserves were beating?

MR FATYELA:

Yes, they were beating us.

MS SEROKE:

Thank you.

MS BURTON:

Mr Fatyela you have given us a picture of a very hard time in the middle
1980ís and we see that thereís still a great deal of conflict and
suffering in our area. Thank you for helping to understand some of that.
You have made a very modest request and I hope that it will be possible
for you to acquire a skill and find employment. Thank you very much for
coming today.

MR FATYELA:

I also thank you.
