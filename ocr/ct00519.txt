COLIN DE SOUZA: Okay.

DR ORR: Thank you chair, hello Colin, we've been speaking to

each other a lot over the last two days. And now you are going to speak
to this audience and to the country.Colin you're a young man, but in your
life, I think you've gone through experiences which people much-much
older than you probably never ever dream of.At the age of 15 you were
recruited by MK and became part of the Bonteheuwel Military Wing which
Muhammad Ferhelst told us about.You were on the run, in hiding, your life
was disrupted and then in 1987 you were arrested.Can you tell us what
happened to you that - at that time in October 1987. --- Well I was
arrested on the 2nd of October 1987 at 5:00 am the morning.During my
arrest there were about 30 - 40 Security Branch policeman that took part
in the whole arrest and we were took that morning to Brackenfell police
station where we all were lined up, we were about 18 to 20 young comrades
of Bonteheuwel.I was part of the comrades that was lined up there and
first of all they took our names and I knew I was very wanted by the
Security Police, and I gave the false name Mark Bresick with a false
address also.During that whole day as I was standing in the line you know
also waiting to be interrogated by the Security Police all my comrades
went one by one in and I could have heard how they were screaming and
shouting how they were being beaten up by Security Police you know.And -
but four o'clock the afternoon, this one security bloke he called me and
he said to -asked okay now what is your name, I said Mark Bresick, your
address, I gave the false address again and he called me into a room and
he called this one cop in with the name of Todd and this guy was like an
artist you know, he 'drawed' sketches about people you know and
descriptions and he said to me like open your bek maak oop jou bek and I
had this(indistinct)teeth you know and they said now we know you are
Porky. And immediately at that time they phoned Loop Street and they
informed all their branches that they got the main - the main guy they -
they were looking for and during that five minutes that whole police
station was swarmed with security personnel that came in you know and it
was almost like an interview you know.And these people they were laughing
and making jokes, say how we caught up with you, we thought you were a
big guy but now we see you are only a small child or a boy, but you have
a lot to tell us and you know a lot.Then I was being introduced to
Captain Van Brakel, he told me that for the past two years, he was
chasing me and they were part of an investigating unit that was being
empowered or gave - that get a mandate by Adriaan Vlok that time to catch
us or kill us.That was what he told me, from there I was being - 'tooken'
to Elsies River police station where I was being kept that weekend
there.And the Monday morning of the next - following weekend Sergeant
Pukker, Captain Van Brakel, Attie Strydom, and another boer with the name
also Attie, they came there and they brought a tea table you know this
tea trolley tables they brought one of that tables in with stacks of
files on it, there was about 300 files and during that next two weeks,
they would interrogate me about - over all that 300 files.They said some
of the files was named Colin de Souza, some was named Porky, some was
just named Bonteheuwel Military Wing.They would question me about attacks
that 'happens' and policeman's houses, bombs that went up, about
comrades, Ashley Kriel, Anton Fransch, Andrew November.After they were
finished with that two weeks with me, that interrogation at Elsies River
police station, they took me this one morning to a field in Bonteheuwel
where I had to show out where this arms cache were as they would call it
a DLB that time, dead letter box, we went at five o'clock at that morning
on the 15th of October 1987 we went to this field opposite the Machete.
The Security Police they were digging up that whole field, apparently
they found nothing and there was this one boer all that I know about him,
he said he was the wit wolf of the Eastern Cape.He said to me yes Porky,
I will necklace you - I will necklace you just the way I necklaced all
the other comrades in - mainly in the Eastern Cape.And you mustn't play
jokes with us, this is the spade that I hit Ashley with and then they
took me away you know.Took me to a Magistrate where they like forcibly
made me to gave a false statement, a statement that I didn't even read,
that I didn't even see.After that they took me to Victor 'Verster', when
I 'camed' at Victor 'Verster' I made a complaint against one of the
officers Constable Kahn, I told the ordinance there this hospital
ordinance that this officer Khan he assaulted me on the morning of the
arrest and they formally lodged a complaint against him.From - I was just
about two weeks there at Victor 'Verster', I would say more like a
holiday or a rest, then I was being fetched by Kahn and Strydom or other
boers also and they took me back toKuilsrivier police station.The day
when I 'camed' at Kuils River police station, there were like Military
Intelligence people, State Security Branch, people of the Secret Service,
all wanted to question me in connection with bombing attacks and pipeline
structures, they want names, they want

instruct - instructions how the underground operated to where
underground,this underground were linked you know how deep I were in.They
questioned me about Joburg and all these etcetera things you know.

	Colin I am sorry to interrupt, did they assault you or torture you while
they were questioning you? --- Yes - they were beating me at that
stage.And at one incident they were throwing that was during the
afternoon they throw in some teargas canisters in - inside the cell you
know a wet cell you know, this wet with water and they closed the doors
and all the windows were closed but at that time I was still cleaver of
knowing the tricks and the tactics you know of laying down on the ground
and that, the tear gas won't get me, so when they came in, they saw that
I was still conscious, they were expecting somebody after a half an hour
to be unconscious, so what they did is they undress me and they chained
me up, you know my feet, my hands to my feet and they had a special chain
you know, that were used with the prisoners that is on awaiting trial you
know, that chains you know and they would chain me up by my feet and my
hand and put me up against this metal gate you know, this metal and
chained me up to that gate, then start beating me with the batons over my
head, Van Brakel would pull my hair and you know and they was beating me
till I was out.I don't know if it was the next day or if it was that
night, but I regained consciousness while I was laying hanging on that
door, metal door and when I was regaining conscious I thought to myself
why - why am I seeing this people you know not the right side up, but you
know the other way around you know I was - I don't know how to explain it
now.But I was actually half way upside down you know and they came, Van
Brakel came in and he grabbed me by my hair, because I had very long hair
that time you know and he grabbed me and he say, hey Porky, you must now
- you must now stop with your lying for the past three weeks now you
being lying, you were be lying to us the whole time in Elsies River when
we were questioning you and the interrogation, now your time is over,
they start. They didn't want any questions, they just beat me for that
whole night down they left me there without food, water for say about two
days, two and a half days.Then maybe after the second day, I know it was
the Wednesday around there, they untied me, they put me in the shower
just let the water run over me and they themselves put the clothes on
me.And the brought the normal SAP police in, to give me food, but at that
time I wasn't hungry because I was beaten up, then they told me look here
we going to put - took you on a holiday to Joburg, there is still some
unsolved mysteries in Joburg that we have to find out about you mainly a
military head quarters that was being blown up, a hand grenade attack at
Wilgerspruit that you probably would know of.The Thursday morning around
about two o'clock the morning they come and fetch me out of the cell -
out of the cell, that was Captain Van Brakel and Adjudant Strydom.They
took me by car up to Joburg, when I - the next day at - the Friday
afternoon around about six o'clock I arrived at John Vorster Square
together with Captain Van Brakel and Adjudant Strydom.They took me up to
the third floor on John Vorster Square, I came into a security room that
were full of TV's you know and actually they - and every cell there was a
TV camera and they could have monitory you - monitored you from that TV
room you know and just for a brief moment I saw on one of these TV
cameras that there were my co-accused John de Vos he was laying there in
one of these cells and they put me in the last cell on the third floor.
And as the night passedone of these policeman, SAP policeman that had to
check on us during the night, he came in there and he said oh! I see you
from Cape Town, and he told me he is also from Cape Town and where he
parents staying and they said, I see here is two people, it's you and
John de Vos.And I said to him look here, during - are you going to be on
the staff that is in the morning, he said yes, I asked him is it possible
for you to take me out, when you take me out for shower to take John de
Vos also out, he said no he would do it as a favor.The very next morning
he took me and John de Vos out, the time when I get in contact with John
de Vos in the shower, I saw that John de Vos's whole - one of - I think
it was his right or left side, of his body was limped, you know and he
was like shivering and his one side, almost like a person who had a
stroke.And I asked him what were wrong, he told me no before they brought
him to Cape Town, they also electric shocked him you know and he had
severely body pains you know and he then he complained to see to doctor,
and then they took him down to the doctor and the afternoon when they
took me again out for showering, we - apparently we went for three or -
three times a day for showering me and John de Vos he told me that the
doctor only gave him Panado pills.He said nothing stronger than Panado's
so they were keeping us a week for their investigation in Joburg, mainly
investigating about Khotso House activities, how the World Counsel of
Churches, the South African Counsel of Churches were assisting us with
money during the time when we were in Joburg in 1987 also. After that
week they took me and John de Vos like - they actually took us back to
Cape Town and then Van Brakel he came the Thursday and he said ja Porky I
have a surprise for you and I asked what surprise and he told me no John
de Vos is here also.It was like this, they didn't want me of knowing that
John de Vos was also that time there for their investigation, so I was
laughing them out, so I told them - I told them that me and John de Vos
was for the past week showering together so there was no secret in that,
so they were very angry.So they took us down to Cape Town to Kuilsrivier
police station, two days after that they take us to a Court in Goodwood,
where I was released in my parents consent.I was released under house
restrictions, I had to be like seven o'clock till seven - the night till
seven, the next morning I had to be in my house, you know you mustn't be
more than five people - persons in that house, otherwise I can be
detained.I had to go and sign at the police stations at night also
because they were afraid that I would leave the country.

	Can - you were then under house arrest for a fairly long time and were
then arrested for possession of explosives in June 1988. --- Correct yes.

	Can you tell us what happened around that incident? --- I was arrested
the night round about ten - ten o'clock - June 16 1988.Apparently the
police were chasing a group of comrades that wanted to set up a barricade
and then I was arrested and I was arrested at Ms Barnes house in
Bonteheuwel and during the time of arrest I didn't want to be arrested so
there were like a fight for more than a half an hour between me and the
constable that wanted to arrest me in that house. Apparently he did get
some assistance of other policeman that did come assist him.They beat me
up, took me to the scene where they found like tires and petrol bombs,
they handcuffed me to a electric pole - light pole where they beat me
unconscious.Then after half an hour they 'throwed' me into this big
'ingomo' with all the tires, I was looking more than a tire when I was
coming at Bishop Lavis police station.The night when I came there the
first people to arrive at Bishop Lavis police station of the Security
Police were Sergeant Pukkerr and Captain Du Plessis, Pukkerr would like
question me, hey Porky were you involved when was it, I didn't answer him
nothing I just kept quite because I knew him you know, he was like this
very passive guy like asking passive, speaking very passively and
sincerely to me and he said no man Porky give your - gee like your
samewerking like they were speaking in Afrikaans.And then Du Plessis
would just every time hit me with his fist and say jong go to hell with
that, still giving you time to think over and plan, and he would hit me
so badly you know I would just lay on the ground and then they putchair
against the door you know, open the door and they put the chair in the
door and they said to me look here we want you stand on top of this chair
because we want to take your height and without I knowing that Captain Du
Plessis was standing on top of a table or a chair at the back side of
this open door and then he grabbed me around me neck and choked me with
his arm you know.Choked me all - till I was like out you know and after
that - ten - twenty minutes of beating up there, they left me, you know
took me to a cell and throw me - threw me in the cell there. After a few
days Strydom would come here and he would question me about shooting
incidents that happened and the highways and they allege it was the
Bonteheuwel Military Wing that did it.And I said no I don't know nothing
about that I am more in my house than I were before I was on the run.And
so I was sent to Goodwood Court, when I came in the Court there was still
some other

co-accused that were also arrested after I was arrested, they all did get
R100-00 of bail, R200-00 of bail but the Court denied me any bail.The I
was remanded back to Durbanville police station.I was kept there for two
weeks without nothing, without any questions that they would come and ask
me, nothing, I was just kept there.I still remember on the end of the
this two weeks Constable Kahn he would came and he would come and fetch
this new raincoat my mother just bought me from Cape Union Mart, avocado
green one, and he would fetch it and I would ask him why would you want
this coat.He told me no apparently the policeman saw you were running
with this coat, so I told him that policeman who was there the night when
they arrested me, why didn't he gave that, that time in the evidence, why
you come now, he said no don't worry.From there I was straight back to
Goodwood Court where I was remanded back to Pollsmoor prison.The time
when I was remanded to Pollsmoor I was being thrown amongst political
prisoners or in a separate cell, I was being thrown amongst criminals and
I was kept there for six weeks in detention in Pollsmoor.And I can still
remember my lawyer was Christine Burger, and she did come and visit me
just two weeks before my Court case had to 'came' up and she said to me
Porky, Mr Moosa them all they did try to get a bail, they tried at the
Appeal Court also, the Appeal Court denied any bail, the Supreme Court
denied any bail, there is no bail for you, you - we just want you to
accept if you come on the Court that there is no - not going to be a
bail. Two weeks after that I went to Court and this certain day when I
came on Court, Constable Kahn he came there down to me in the cells, he
said to me kyk hier Porky we going to give you a bail, but just remember
tonight you are a dead man.And immediately when my lawyer came she said
oh! they very surprised, this is Ms Burger that the found that the State
is going to give me a bail of R1,000-00 then immediately I told her look
her this Security policeman he told me they going to give me a bail, but
tonight I am going to be killed.So that day my bail was a R1,000-00 it
was being paid.I went out, I went with my father to Woodstock where I
washed and my brother-in-law Kevin was also with me and the night here
around about six o'clock because I had to be seven o'clock in my house,
six o'clock we returned to Bonteheuwel where I stayed at 21B Candlewood
Street.At that - at that same time I was still busy eating my food and I
heard this familiar knock on the door and I was standing inside the -
inside the - nearby the toilet you know in the - near to the sitting room
you know and I heard the comrades Jacques Adonis he was asking Ms De
Souza, Mr De Souza is Porky here, my mother said no Porky isn't here he
is somewhere else he is not sleeping at home.And they said, then they
said okay, we did watch you the whole time, we knew Porky were here,
Porky came with you and apparently at that time Jacques draw out a gun to
force his way into the house like to shoot me and my father grabbed him
and there was a whole twist outside and my brother-in-law he hit Jacques
you know and the gun fall - fall over the balcony right down you know and
they chased the group, it was a group of youths it was about sixteen of
them you know. Some of them were with me in this - in this trials of the
BMW and the chase went right around the street and my father and my
brother-in-law they arrived.At that time I had a firearm but it was for
my own purpose.I took out the firearm, I put it underneath my jersey, I
went outside because I check now it's too dangerous to be inside the
house.And I want to move now, out of the area.As we were still standing
outside to move this group of comrades and there was some gangsters also
with, they came shooting around the corner, before even they take the
bend the shots was firing and they were shooting and throwing bricks and
my mother and my father they ran into this, and with my baby brother ran
into this people downstairs house, that there surname were Brooks, they
ran into this house and these people locked the door, and I and my
brother-in-law Kevin Arendse was still outside, locked outside.The people
inside didn't want to open the door and here these people were preparing
to shoot and there was like a big fight you know and one guy he was still
trying to cork the gun but the gun jammed you know and at that time as I
was shouting open the door, the people inside opened the door and as my
brother-in-law Kevin Arendse and I ran into the house, and the door
closed the shots just went down and the bullets ran through the doors and
through the windows and all that.

	Colin you said in your statement that you found out later that the
police had actually deliberately misinformed the community so that they
would come out to get you the way they did that night.--- Correct yes -
yes.

	So it was a campaign by the police to stir the community up against you.
--- Correct because during my first arrest, police people like Sergeant
Pukkerr who was in the Military Intelligence, he said to me that I don't
have to worry if I don't want to give my collaboration with them.They
have - their ears and eyes are like in Bonteheuwel day and night and they
got top informers with inside the pipelines of - of the ANC of Umkontho
we Sizwe.And I am already being branded as a informer, so I don't have to
worry, so I expected that things to come.

	Colin you then went into hiding again because obviously you were at risk
both from the community and from the police. --- Correct.

	Until in January 1989 you decided to leave the country. --- Correct yes.

	Can you tell us what happened on that day. --- My father was - he was
suppose to drive us from Cape - out of Cape Town as far as Joburg because
he was quite familiar with the routes you know.And I was in the car and
my girlfriend, later to be my wife, she was also in the back seat in the
car and I was sitting in the front seat in the passenger side, my father
was driving the car.As we approached the airport, I saw this Hi Ace van
full of Security cops and I eventually knew that same time that the cops
were on our trail.We went into the airport and we organized we - we get
this car of Avis Car Hire service, a new City Golf and there were some
Security guys with video cameras that rolled their video cameras on us
you know and as we came out of the airport, this one commuter Hi Ace,
they tried to you know to pull us down, to - like to put up a barricade
in front of the road. But we drove past them, knowing that my father was
a very good driver and he had a number of awards when he was working at
Total of being a very good driver you know.And we drove past them and at
that time Strydom and Attie and some other Security cops, they drove past
us, next to us with a maroon Toyota Corolla and they were like waving
with their guns to us, like pull down, pull down and I was just waving my
hand to them like saying goodbye.And the shooting didn't start there and
they were chasing us, right through Old Crossroads, and we - they chased
us to the Old Crossroads, there were a whole convoy of Security cops,
cars and vehicles, 4 x 4 vehicles and apparently that time there was MK
people inside KTC that opened fire on them.And they lost us for a few
moments, we drive through Mandalay and then they catch up against us,
Constable Kahn drove right in front of us and as we passed through them
into Mitchell's Plain, without knowing that they were having a helicopter
monitoring us from the air you know.Then they were chasing us right down
Bayden and Power Drive as you take the - to turn into Swartklip.As we
took that road into Swartklip we were actually driving very fast you
know, they couldn't catch up with their cars.I immediately see at the
back of us there was like this maroon - metallic blue Alfa Romeo came
right from the back very fast and this guy he was hanging out with a
machine gun and he was shooting at - shooting at our wheels.And at that
time they shot our wheels flat, both our back wheels were flat and they
shot through the windows, the back windows were in, the front windows,
all the windows of the car was in, the car started to burn, and at that
time Van Brakel and his other Security cops had the time to come near us
and they were shooting just - you know they were driving next to us you
know and shooting with the 16 shooters you know, but most of the koeËls
most of the bullets missed us by seconds. I can remember I was sitting
low in my seat and the head cover of the seat you know it was full of -
full of bullets you know because the sponge you know, it grabbed some of
the bullets there you know and I kept my door the whole time open while
they were shooting because I realized if they were catching me here with
my father and my girlfriend, they would kill us.And they would - either
they would put that - they would put a lot of firearms in that car and
say to the news look here we did catch the terrorist, they had a very
good history on me and I knew I had to get away to escape and I told my
father look, drive me just to the near urban place where there is
houses.And we drove as we took the road into Strandfontein, from
Strandfontein Village -from Strandfontein Pavilion in - right to
Strandfontein Village we hit a car because we didn't have any more
balance, there was no brakes, there weren't a fifth gear, we only had
four gears.We didn't have steering, we turned again right to come into
Strandfontein Village.At that time the Security police they shot again
our car with shotguns and heavy artillery.Our car went up the hill on the
sand hill, it came down on two wheels you know, the car was - we were
driving with two wheels.We went the first road to our left in - into
Strandfontein Road - Strandfontein Village.The only way of getting brakes
that my father had to drive up into a driveway and to crash inside that
people's driveway and the idea was when he go into the driveway, and he
like get a break you know with the gear or whatever, I had to jump out in
that time and run. And I remember when I opened my door, I still shout to
them jump, but their doors couldn't open because it was shot closed you
know.The locks were all broken you know and I jumped over the wall, the
time when I was jumping over the wall, one Security woman - police lady
she jumped out with a 9mm shot machine gun and the bullets just went so
over the - you know over the wall like dust, I just saw dust you know.And
they were chasing after me in the hills there in Strandfontein but to
advance I had combat boots on, now I didn't sink in the sand but they
sank, because they had all tackies, they were like prepared to - prepared
to catch me.But I was very fast on my feet and I know if I - of my past
experience of running for them and of gorilla experience I knew if I am
going run, deep into this bush, these people would catch up with me.So I
decided I would use the half moon formation that gorilla's would normally
use to advance when they camp out or if they know if the enemies is
trailing them on the border line, they would move in a half moon and they
would just encircle the enemy from the back and I used that advantage and
run in a half moon position and just come out on the second road on the
other side you know.And I ran into Strandfontein Village and hide myself
underneath people's bushes till the night fall.And that whole
Strandfontein was - it was cordoned down you know they had roadblocks,
the - I know there were more than 2,000 police people, the dogs unit were
there, there we helicopters throwing their lights in the bushes.And I
stayed there underneath the bushes the whole night till some lady, there
were some a Muslim lady I went to her, I tell her - I told her look here
lady, I am a member of the ANC, I am a member of Umkontho we Sizwe and I
put my whole trust in you, this boers they want to kill me. And she sent
her daughter around because I told her look here, she must take this
watch and put it in her hair and when they come there and - on the scene
and they must just show it to my father and my girlfriend, maybe they
would catch on that I am safe.When they came there they couldn't come
near the scene it was like cordoned off you know, they came back this
lady, but I put my whole trust in her you know and maybe that saved my
life, if this lady were an informer that police would have 'catched' me
just there you know without people knowing.And I told her I just want to
come out of Mitchell's Plain, so she told me the best way to come out now
is with some church people that is in the road, that is going to church
the New Apostolic people because there is like roadblocks and all this.So
she told this New Apostolic people that I am family of them and I got
lost, that's why the only - I only know where they were staying so these
people must only give me a lift as far as Mitchell's Plain Town Centre.I
climbed in the back of the car and I grabbed of these Psalm books you
know, where the people sing out the New Apostolic people, church people
sing out and I was reading through it you know and making like I was bit
of a religious.Now what they made is when they saw a suspicious guy the
roadblock they would show with the torches and they stopped that car, now
they see no this is church people and because I had this brother's jacket
on you know a church jacket on.And I was sitting at the back of the car
and the book was in my face and they said okay this car can go past let
me stop the bus. And I drove out - drove out of Mitchell's Plain to the
Town Centre.From there I moved with the train as far as Bonteheuwel that
night, at Heideveld station the police was waiting, when I - when the
train was approaching the station, I saw the whole police was standing
there.I jumped out of - from the train as it was still driving you know,
by the bridge nearby the police station.I ran to my brother in
Bonteheuwel, I told him look here they caught up with us, so my brother
organized a place where I could go into hiding for that few days.But as I
was staying in that - in that place of hiding, at that certain priest
house, he became also afraid of having me there because they were having
a manhunt over the Western Cape over the TV, over the radio and all that,
giving my 'prescription'.So he said he can't have me there long, so I
went on my own initiative out on the road, that same afternoon I was
being chased from - down - I tried to move to Camps Bay, from Camps Bay,
Cape Town, and from Cape Town to Bonteheuwel as I came into my
grandmother's house, the Murder and Robbery Unit police just came in and
they put their guns next to me and they arrest me.

	Colin after that arrest you were sentenced to a term of imprisonment and
you went to Pollsmoor and were released under one of the indemnities in
1990 is that correct? --- Correct yes.

	I know you've only told us a small part of what you experienced in those
five years and I am sorry that there is not time for us to hear more.But
it's very obvious that a large part of your life was spent being
harassed, detained, tortured, intimidated, threatened, imprisoned, how
has that affected your life? --- It did affect my life because a number
of jobs that I went to go and work mainly I am trained in security, I
know all security skills, when I went to that jobs people give me a
firearm and all that, I found that I - I would get, immediately when I
have a firearm in my hand, I can't perform my security duties, sometimes
I am becoming to nervous or to tense. At one incident I was just shooting
at a guy, shooting to kill, and I realized okay this is going to put me
in prison, so I rather I am going to leave this job and I left that
job.And I tried to went - to go to the Military also, when I was still in
my training in Pretoria about two years ago on Wamanstal, I just felt
sick and the only thing that the field hospital doctors were saying is a
general body malaise.And after that I analyzed it through speaking to
doctors and they told me that, that is the condition of the body that is
over tired and the body can't stand the stress any more and I was sent to
a specialist in that field you know that 'dealed' with tortured people
and he said I was tortured so severely you know that the stress built up
on my small brain you know because of keeping secrets and that stuff all
in you know and it formed almost like a cancer in mybrain, that's why all
my hair, I lost all my hair you know during that time when I was in
prison for that two years you know.And so the 'recomendated' medical
treatment for me and I am still under treatment psychologically and
medication, still today.

	Colin thank you very much and I am going to ask your mother just to
speak to us for a while and then I am sure my colleagues would want to
ask you some questions to.So can you just move the microphone across.

DOROTHY DE SOUZA:

DR ORR: Ms De Souza we've listened with horror I think to what Colin has
told us. Can you perhaps tell us how - what was happening to him affected
you and your family during those years. --- Certainly it has affected our
family in many ways for instance I just recalled the time when he said he
had to go - had to appear in Court at Goodwood, that was with the second
trial.That evening we were preparing to go to bed early because of the
next morning as we had to be there very early as his parents.And I
remember while we were sleeping there was a knock on the door and it was
two Security police and they demanded that my husband had to go with them
and I refused to let my husband out of the room, I said no we should, you
know as well that we should be tomorrow in Court very early to be with
our son as he is appearing.They said no but your husband must go with
because Colin is at Bellville police station and he wants to see you.And
as you know we had no confidence in the police because of what we went
through as a family.I refused and I asked them to give their names and
they didn't want to identify themselves and I said I had no trust in them
and I'll never allow my husband to come out of the room.And I was trying
to be tough there and stood up with them and they left.And as they left I
told my husband I don't think we should sleep here tonight here is
something very funny going on, I just had this strange feeling that
something they - I don't know what they were planning up their sleeve.And
we - we had the car that time still we moved out of the house with the
smallest boy was still three years old and the daughter was about ten, we
moved out of the house with our kids and as we rode out there is a circle
in our street in Candlewood Street, and when we got to the circle we met
up with the Security police and that was an half an hour after they
suppose to leave our house, but they were still there in the area. And I
told them where can we go to because no-one is going to open their doors
for us because people were sort of - sort of staying away from us and
being very one sided because of the mess we as the family were in.And
it's almost like we were the perpetrators and as we moved out of the
house they had the audacity and followed us in the car at the back and
they actually tried to shoot us off the road, me and my husband and the
two kids.And they were chasing us through the roads down the freeway and
I said to him we going to hospital and he said what do you mean we going
to hospital, I said just go to hospital, the child is sick, I wanted him
to get a grip of the story because they were listening in and we had no
privacy.And they had this bugs everywhere and because they were pausing
next to us in the next car.And as we drove they followed us to the
hospital chasing us like they were chasing criminals.They had no - they
didn't even think that we weren't involved, we were just the parents of
Colin and I had the small baby there in the car and my daughter and they
chased us through the streets as far as the hospital.And there we had to
leave our car outside Red Cross Hospital and phone some friends and that
was another priest he is not here in the country any more.He had to
assist us to take us to some people's houses so we could sleep for the
night in order to get to Court the next day so that we can be with our
son.We slept there that night and the next morning we went to Court. We
met the same police there, which made as if they didn't know us, and
anything like that happened that same night.And it was a strain on the
family to think that they harassing us in such a way they could of
knocked us off the road or drastic accident could have happened and we
couldn't - we should never have been there at Colin's side.And as Colin
said the same night that he was - these comrades came to shoot him, I
know I don't blame them today because I know it was the way the police
worked to make us look as if were informers and that night they also
treated us very badly because we couldn't turn to the police, but the
neighbours in the street because of we knew it was comrades, and we
didn't want to be drag them to Court as my son and them were involved.And
so other people called the police and I was very hurt because of what the
Captain said, Captain Van Brakel over the phone to this policeman, he
said to him, I can't remember his name but I can picture him well.He said
to him there wasn't any shooting, there was no shooting incident.And he
said but the evidence is here, the exhibits are here and there was a
shooting incident and the bullets are there and the neighbours have
confirmed it.Yes and actually he said, don't take any notice, just go
away and leave that people alone and it hurt me to think that this
policeman stood there, he wanted to help me, but he couldn't because this
Captain he was of Murder and Robbery, Captain van Brakel, he was one of
the perpetrators as well, he said to him, he must leave us and we were
destitute.We had to find our own way out of that mess, and I remember
Jacques Adonis very well.I met him and I had, I felt guilty even though
they were the people that came to my house and he came to me one day and
he said Ms De Souza I've come to apologize because it wasn't my intention
to hurt your family and I did forgive him and I am very glad I did,
because it weren't long after that, I think two months after that, he was
also killed. And thinking about this hearing Colin's story again, some
incidences seems like it were funny, but to us as a family it really hurt
us, there were times we didn't even feel like speaking to one another or
eating because we were all very frail and thin, my husband even lost his
job at the time because of going to Court in and out every day.No it
weren't like a week or two weeks, it was more than a year that we had to
go every day with our son to Court, and it is as if we were on trial.And
the saddest thing was the day that he had to go to prison on top of it he
was in maximum security with rapist, murders, you name it for two years
he never came out.I even begged them to let him go out and work somewhere
so that he can just do something with his hands, but they said no he is a
political prisoner, he wasn't sent to Robben Island, he had to stay there
in that prison, day in and day out without working or doing something
with his hands.Sometimes there were times that they cut our visits and we
couldn't see him, we don't know the reasons why.I think that was part of
the way to torture the family and eventually Colin came out but when he
came out of prison he weren't a boy any more, of course he was with evil
people inside.And today we still trying to support Colin as a family
which is very hard because we not medical doctors, he is not every day
the same.Frustration builds up in him, he has got a little boy of four
years old, and I am very sorry because I don't know how I am going to
tell his child why his daddy isn't working and why his daddy's got this
ways and all that. So it's really spoilt our whole family and another
further generation to come, because Colin is also going to grow - his son
is going to grow up and it's going to affect him, because he is not with
his dad.So that's my story.

	[indistinct] now the effect on one person doesn't stay there, but there
is a ripple effect and it affects different people, different generations
and I know it must be very painful for you, thank you for sharing with
us. --- Yes.

	I am now going to hand over to the Chairperson.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much Dr Orr, do you have any questions.Mr
Potgieter.

MR POTGIETER: Thank you Chairperson.Colin [intervention]

CHAIRPERSON: Order, can I please ask people not to move around during the
witnesses giving evidence, and if you must please do so quietly, it's not
fair on the witness.

MR POTGIETER: Thank you Chairman.

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Potgieter.

COLIN DE SOUZA

MR POTGIETER: Thank you Chairperson, Colin you referred in your evidence
to a policeman who referred to himself as the wit wolf of the Eastern
Cape. --- Correct ja.	

	Let me just, I want to ask you something very specific about that,
because it seems to affect the evidence that was given in an earlier
case, that of Ashley Kriel.You say that there was reference to a spade
and you were told that you would also be beaten like that.--- Ja.

	Who actually said that? --- I don't know this policeman his name, but I
know he was the one, himself, who called himself the wit wolf and
Sergeant Pukker, they two were responsible, they were the two guys that
took John de Vos up to Joburg, should it be - so it won't be difficult to
locate to his name.And he weren't like a guy from the Western Cape that I
knew because I knew like all the Security cops.He was like a new guy.

	And what was he actually suggesting, was he suggesting that or implying
that he had beaten Ashley Kriel with a spade. --- Ja, that is what he
said to my because the morning when they were digging, they were finding
- they found no firearms in that field, only scrap metal, doors of cars
you know and then he said this guy eventually, this guy Porky lied to us
because they took me out of the van and the throw a blanket over me and
took me to where they dug this holes and then he start threatening me, he
said you see this - this spade, this is how I - I myself hit Ashley with
this spade, that is what he was implying.And I will hit you the same way,
and after that he said, I will also necklace you how I - the way I
necklaced other guys in the Eastern Cape.

	Okay, you also said that you laid a charge against Mr Kahn one of the
policeman. --- Correct yes.

	What happened to that charge? --- After I was being released the charge
had to be followed up and Security police everyday they use to come and
harass us, every morning at home, me and my family and eventually one
morning me and my mother went with them they took us to I think that was
Sergeant Pukker and I - and some other cop, but they took us to Roy
Beamish here on Modderdam Road where they had this juristical office
where all the big bosses of the Security police were and they took us
into a office of Colonel Niehaus and I could - I could have seen all this
other policeman whether they were Captains or Colonels, they were all
having a respect for this guy, and this guy he said to me they even made
tea like we are friends you know they made tea and offered tea and he
said no I must eat biscuits sommer also. And he took out my file and - a
file of mine out of his volt, and he said we now want you - you must
withdraw this case because here I got the evidence that shows you had to
be killed, you are lucky that the wrong police arrested you on the 2nd of
October, because did the right police arrested you, the right guys arrest
you, the orders was already been 'putten' out that you must be killed.And
he showed to me a paper that was actually a death certificate that was
stamped and was being signed by the State Security branch, the head of
the State Security police branch.I read the name with the name of Viljoen
on the signature.He showed it to my mother we all were shocked, he said
here I am having all the other comrades names, he named the names Ashley
Kriel, Anton Fransch, Andrew November and Colin de Souza.And I was like
shocked - shocked for what this guy showed me there at that office.So
during that - you know the harassing us and I said okay I would withdraw
the cases you know just to get them from my back, I withdraw the case
from Constable Kahn.

	Okay, I assume you not happy with that. --- No.

	With that result. --- No.

	You did that under duress. --- Correct yes.

	You also said that when you were in Johannesburg and you were being
questioned.--- Correct.

	Interrogated you were amongst other things asked about Khotso House.

--- Correct yes.

	What was that about? --- It was mainly what was the - who was supplying
us with money, while - because they had like information that the Counsel
of Churches, South African Counsel of Churches were the people that put
us in hiding and in sanctuary and they were funding us with money.And
they wanted to know who in Khotso House - there was a man with the name
of Ike Macetsli, they named him, they - they named the head - the head
person in charge of Khotso House, Frank Chikane, they said Reverent Frank
Chikane at any times also offered you money, were Khotso House involved
in sending people out into exile through the church, were they using the
church and particular what formations of the church were involved,
particular in Joburg.And to priest, priest names and all that.

	Thank you, then just finally, briefly in your statement you made a
statement to the effect that they hurt your father and your girlfriend.
--- Ja.

	What - what do you mean by that, just briefly can you explain that. ---
My father was beaten up very severely, the time - say two weeks after I
were in - after I was arrested and I was inside I found my father the one
day, they took me to Mannenberg police station the morning and I see here
my father is also beaten up, his gums inside and eyes and maybe my mother
would know a bit more, because I was also beaten up you know.And my
girlfriend she was pregnant at that time and what they actually did is
they sent her to this Dr Siroky at Bellville South and he actually gave
her this abortion pills in, they forced it into her and she knew because
they forced in and after having her two days in detention, she would
start bleeding and everything would come down and they sent her home.

	Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON: Any other questions, Mr De Souza can you just tell me again
the name of the Doctor? --- His name is Dr Siroky.

	And where is he practicing? --- He were practicing in Bellville South as
a District Surgeon for the State a few years ago, about four - five years
ago, he was still practicing there.

	Thank you very much.Ms De Souza I want to thank you for your testimony,
I know that you found that hard and difficult, I think we can quess of
some of the burden that you have carried and Dr Orr has already
underlined the unbelievable suffering that was brought upon not only on
individuals but on families.And that, that suffering continues until
today.It's very hard, but it's very heartening for us to hear the way you
and your husband stood by your son, now that didn't happen all the time
and there must of been times when you were critical and worried and full
of strain and stress and yet you've come through it and you continue to
take a stand with him as you are today publicly.And we want to thank you
very much indeed for that.You could have spent many hours telling us I
know, but what you have said gives us a window into what has been
happening in your life and the life of your family.Colin we don't know
what to say to you, you have experienced so much in a very short life.So
much of what is bad, what is negative, what is cruel, and you together
with so many others, young people, you were never young, you just had no
opportunity and we really find it difficult to know how to respond to the
cruelty that is possible within human kind. We are glad to hear that you
are finding help in the Trauma Centre, we hope you will continue to do
that because you bear upon your body and your soul, scars which won't be
very easy to be taken away, it's going to take a very long time.We have
taken note of what you have told us, we will follow up whatever we can
do, and we hope that by coming here today, by talking with Dr Orr over
those last couple of days, by telling us your story publicly, that this
will not only be a testimony to what our past has been like, but also
part of healing by exposure, by sharing that something of the bitterness
and the awful, awful experience that you've had will in some way assist
you to bear that burden in the future.We want to thank you both and we
salute you, thank you. --- Thank you.
