MR LEWIN: Thanks very much. I ask Tom Manthata to lead your evidence.

MR MANTHATA: Who is accompanying you Mrs Sibiya ?

MRS SIBIYA: This is my daughter.

MR MANTHATA: Itís your daughter ?

MRS SIBIYA: Itís my son, Iím sorry. Itís ...............

MR MANTHATA: Is he a student ?

MRS SIBIYA: Not anymore.

MR MANTHATA: Mrs Sibiya, are you working too ?

MRS SIBIYA: Iím not working.

MR MANTHATA: And Mr Sibiya ? What does Mr Sibiya do ?

MRS SIBIYA: Heís doing nothing. Heís home.

MR MANTHATA: But you have children who are attending school ?

MRS SIBIYA: Yes, I do.

MR MANTHATA: How many are they ?

MRS SIBIYA: Only one and the other one is at the cr»che. Nisamsu.

MR MANTHATA: I see. Mrs Sibiya, you are to tell us about your husband,
Nbwenbwe who died. Can you please tell us that sad story.

MRS SIBIYA: It was January the 23rd. I will start by saying that my
husband was working night shift on that day. He was supposed to enter at
about ten oíclock and he was supposed to knock off at six oíclock in the
morning. It was the twenty third on Friday. Early that morning he didnít
come back home. My mother came to our house and she inquired as to his
whereabouts. I told her that he didnít return from work. At the time she
found me busy sweeping the floor. She asked my to come inside. She then
told me that a young man came to wake her up at about five oíclock in the
morning and said that the gunshots that we heard at night relates to the
incident where my husband was shot and killed. She suggested that we have
to go to the scene of the incident. When we arrived there we were met by
blood running all over on the ground.

MR MANTHATA: Yes, Mrs Sibiya we are with you in re-living your pain. Just
relax and take it slowly, coolly.

MRS SIBIYA: As Iíve said it before, there was blood all over the ground.
The were some marks drawn on the ground and we heard that the police came
to take some evidence and we were told that we mustnít touch that because
it might tamper with the evidence. There were three.... Later we found
him at the mortuary. In the township on that date there was great
confusion because one of the Inkatha leaders were killed and people were
saying that if one Inkatha member was killed other people should be
killed to prepare the burial for him. The time came where we had to bury
him. We didnít live in peace at home at that moment especially amongst
the whole family, the children and other members of the family. I had to
leave and go to Johannesburg to SAROís offices because he was a member of
this organization. I explained to them about my problem. They sent me
back to Ermelo to the police to go and collect a statement. The
investigating officer was Mr Nkonjani. I tried to look for Nkonjani and I
was referred to Meyer and Meyer gave me some papers and he told me that
the case is over so I can take the papers back to Johannesburg to give
them to SARO.

	I took the papers back to Johannesburg and I gave them at the offices
and I asked them to give me copies of the papers because I didnít know
exactly who killed my husband so I wanted to find out what I got from the
police that the case was over. I came back with the papers trying to find
a way as to how am I going to live with it because I didnít even have
money to engage some lawyers in this case. Even the children couldnít
continue with their education like Vusa beside me. He had to drop out
from school. He also realized that schooling wasnít well for him because
there was no one to support him and pay his school fees. If he needed
school shoes he couldnít get them in time or get them at all. I would say
that even now we are living within a thin thread and itís so difficult to
survive. We normally live by my brother who is also married. I would say
this is a painful situation for the whole family. After discovering that
the Truth Commission was coming to this area I went to give a statement
to Mr Nkosi. Itís because I wanted some help. I have a problem paying
rent which is high. I try to pay. At the moment I paid about half of my
rent and they told me that I must have paid the full balance before the
27th. ...(inaudible) families. From that time, thatís the last time I got
the help from these ...(inaudible) families and after the death of my
husband they couldnít even help me at all.

	I hope that maybe things to come to pass and we will discover the
killers of my husband because at the moment this caused the estrangement
between the families. I would like to see the people convicted for his
murder, just to find out their identities. Maybe they are people whom I
know. Just to make sure that my children are also safe because I donít
even know them. Thatís all.

MR MANTHATA: Mrs Sibiya, we are mindful of the state in which you are Mrs
Sibiya. We wouldnít like to provoke you further and bring about the same
sad memories of the loss of your husband but we would have loved to know
whether you are still in touch with SARO or officials of SARO in
Johannesburg.

MRS SIBIYA: I last met the SARO leadership at the time I went to Joíburg.
That was the last time I met them and I havenít seen them up to now
because they told me that the person I used to meet with, Sandile got
involved in an accident and he passed away. When I went back to their
offices they said they couldnít find my files and they donít know where
he stored them.

MR MANTHATA: These papers that you are talking about, the papers which
were given by Meyer and Nkonjani, do you still have them on you ?

MRS SIBIYA: The papers which were given to me I enclosed with my
statement to the Commission. Did you know the Incatha person that was
buried that day ? Did you know the name of the person ?

MRS SIBIYA: I would say that I donít know his name but he was an old man.
I wouldnít know the surname. He was Mr Twala. He was supposed to be
buried on that particular date. It was on Saturday.

MR MANTHATA: How had Twala died ? Was he a victim of the violence of the
day or what ?

MRS SIBIYA: He was ill. I think he died from his illness. All I know is
that he was one of the top leaders of Inkatha in Ermelo.

MR MANTHATA: If he died from illness, which means there was no
provocation from the Comrades which resulted in his death. I canít
understand how the people in the community were victimized, which let to
the death of your husband.

MRS SIBIYA: It was generally know that if one Inkatha member passed away,
on that particular day during the funeral there should be some killings
directed towards specifically, the Comrades because on that particular
day there were many Inkatha people especially from Kwa Zulu Natal and the
streets were so busy. If they pass your street you have to run for cover.
Maybe he was caught running away. Unfortunately since he was working
within the community he got shot at one oíclock at night.

MR MANTHATA: As you put it nobody amongst the Inkatha people was ever
arrested who could have appeared in court where you could be saying that
person was acquitted because nobody could be identified with the killing.
Sorry, I might have asked a very lengthy question. Iím coming to this
where youíre saying the Commission should help you to find out the person
who killed your husband. Now it becomes clear that you are saying Inkatha
members could have killed your husband on that day but because of that
kind of confusion no single Incatha person was ever brought before the
court being accused with killing your husband. Are we correct to say that
?

MRS SIBIYA: Thatís correct.

MR MANTHATA: Which seems to even defeat the ends of the Commission
because if we accept that there was that kind of mass killing, to get a
single person out of it may not be easy. Iím not saying we are not going
to do it, we are not going to try to find that out, Iím just trying to
point out how difficult the work that you demand of the Truth and
Reconciliation Committee might be. With that in mind we are saying the
Commission will see what it can do. How old is . your son beside you?
Pinkie, Vusa, Iím sorry. How old is Vusa ?

MRS SIBIYA: He is twenty one years old.

MR MANTHATA: Twenty one. How many years is he out of school because of
lack of maintenance ?

MRS SIBIYA: Two years.

MR MANTHATA: Two years. In what grade was he at the time he couldnít go
further ?

MRS SIBIYA: He was in Standard nine.

MR MANTHATA: Standard nine. Does Vusa know what is it he could do if he
had to go back to school ? Or does Vusa just want employment and thatís
the end ?

MRS SIBIYA: He also suggested that he would like to go and work but
unfortunately he canít find employment.

MR MANTHATA: Well, I have no further questions Ma Sibiya. Thanks.

MR LEWIN: Doctor Ally ?

DR ALLY: Mrs Sibiya you husband worked for Spoornet.

MRS SIBIYA: Thatís correct.

DR ALLY: At the time that he died, how many years had he been working for
Spoornet ? Do you have any idea ?

MRS SIBIYA: I think it was about fourteen years.

DR ALLY: Fourteen years. Did Spoornet not pay you out anything from your
husbandís contribution to the Pension Fund or the Provident Fund ? Did
you get any money from Spoornet ?

MRS SIBIYA: Iíd say they did pay some money. It was R13 000 and I used to
receive monthly allowances of R300 00. I used that money to pay rent for
the house and with that money I wasnít able to buy the other necessities.
Do you still get that R300 00 a month from Spoornet ?

MRS SIBIYA: Yes.

DR ALLY: In your statement that you gave to us there is a certificate, it
looks like a Life Insurance Certificate, Old Mutual, a policy. Was this a
policy that your husband had ?

MRS SIBIYA: Thatís correct.

DR ALLY: Did Old Mutual pay you out on this policy ?

MRS SIBIYA: After claiming the money from Old Mutual it was discovered
that my husband had a child outside of the marriage and I was told that
the mother of the child also had a claim on the same money therefore the
lawyer representing the other woman took of the money from Old Mutual.
However it was said that my ............... Old Mutual and the lawyer
went to Old Mutual and represented himself as the person who is
representing me and he managed to get the money out. However we went to
talk to Mr Bia - I would try to telephone Old Mutual in Cape Town and
they said they have sent the money to Ermelo branch and I must go there.
When I went there I was told that the cheque had been signed out by Mr
van Wyk and he is in possession of the cheque. I went to van Wyk and he
said thereís nothing to talk about. He said the money should go to the
child out of the marriage. Thatís how it ended.

DR ALLY: Sorry, letís just try and get this absolutely clear. The money
from Old Mutual, you did not receive any of that money. It went to Mr van
Wyk who said that he was representing the mother of the child that your
husband had with this woman ?

MRS SIBIYA: Thatís true.

DR ALLY: Did you ever try to get any legal advice as to whether what Mr
van Wyk did was legal, was proper ? Did you take up the matter with a
lawyer or any Advice Center ?

MRS SIBIYA: I tried to go to Mr Moody. While we were busy with the case,
he explained to me that the other woman was entitled to the money because
the child was my husbandís child. I used to pay this Mordien, my lawyer
and every time I went there he demanded R200 00 and I gave it to him and
later I gave up and I just thought maybe itís better if they take the
money because thereís nothing coming out of it because I couldnít keep up
the payments with my lawyer. He wanted money every day I went to see him
and the case was taking such a long time.

DR ALLY: Presently what is going on with this case ? Is anything still
happening ?

MRS SIBIYA: Everything is quiet at the moment. I went to some lawyers who
asked me, after getting the cheque. When I arrived at their offices one
of the gentleman who was said to be Chief of the Court talked to them
saying that he couldnít talk to me because if ever he was to talk to me I
should come there with my lawyer and he will talk with my lawyer.
Therefore I contacted Mr Bia. He said I have to make a sworn Affidavit in
connection with the lawyer who took this money unlawfully because Old
Mutual was saying the cheque was signed on my name. Mr Bia called me on
this particular day, to-day, to-date I was supposed to go and see him
unfortunately I had to come to the Commission.

DR ALLY: What sum are we speaking about, this money from Old Mutual, how
much money is it to you ? Were you told ? Do you know ?

MRS SIBIYA: After the death of my husband they gave us two thousand for
burial purposes. They said there was R6 300 remaining as a balance.

DR ALLY: Thank you Mrs Sibiya. In your statement there is the record of
the inquest as well which really says what you say in your statement that
the cause of death of your husband was the result of wounds caused by
shooting to the head and that the person or persons are unknown. Thatís
what the inquest records. Thank you, thank you very much and thanks for
sharing that other information with us.

MR LEWIN: Thank you Doctor Ally. Mrs Sibiya, thank you very much for
coming and sharing that story with us. Thereís no way of saying that you
sadness will be reduced by time. I donít believe that if every can. Itís
obviously very great and very tense at the moment because itís so recent
but all we can hope is that in some way this has contributed in a small
way to making the conflicts of the past easier by explaining what
happened. For you still, you have a young family to look after. You must
find comfort where you can. We offer our sympathy. We will try to provide
the information that you ask for. We do have the case numbers. We have
the phone numbers of the people who for instance signed this declaration
which is August 1994. So we can follow up on that and with our sympathy
we wish you very well and again as I say, thank you very much for coming.
Go well.
