DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, please be seated. Now Iím going to ask if youíll
please put that light off on that - fine and only put it on when the
person is speaking, it helps with the communication.

You are the very first witnesses and Iím quite sure that you are nerves.
If you were not nerves you should be nerves. You have a story to tell it
happened a very long time ago, it will bring back many memories and you
will feel a great deal of pain. Because those memories are very sad ones
and one which caused you great misery a long time ago and you will be
looking again to what happened.

	And I want you to feel very relaxed - you are amongst friends. For the
first time perhaps in your life you have an opportunity to talk to an
official Commission appointed by the President of the country and to tell
us - to tell this audience and to tell South Africa and indeed the world
what happened and what is in your hearts.

Iím going to ask you to be quite brief but at the same time it is your
story and we want you to tell it in your own way. From time to time weíll
be asking different Commissioners to assist in the telling of those
stories but nothing more than that. On this occasion I will be doing that
on your behalf. And first Iím going to call Sylvia Mabija and I would
like you to tell us perhaps something about the Mabija family and then
tell us what happened on that day on the 7th of June in 1977 concerning
your brother.

MS MABIJA:

On the 7th of June the police came, there were two policemen and they got
inside the house. So we were all sitting in the house in the lounge. So
they came in with Phaki and Phaki was dry and looked terrible as a result
of being beaten up by the police. So this police the lifted up the carpet
and after that they went into the bedroom and they searched. I didnít see
them coming out with anything and then after that they went outside with
him at the gate. And then as they were going out by the gate they then
turned back into the house again and they said him "gaan groet jou mense
want jy sal nie vir hulle weer sien nie." So we were surprised and
shocked about this statement but anyway we sat down and talked among
ourselves. It was not long afterwards then I just took my cousin half way
as she was leaving because she was with us and we just heard while we
were on our way that Phakamile is dead. When I heard that it was a
horrible thing to hear and it even became difficult for me to hear this
and this was the most painful experience and I donít even know how I got
home.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much - take you back - could you switch that one off
please, thank you very much. You have told us about the day when the
police brought Phaki back to the house and the day he died. Can you tell
the Commission about the day on which he was arrested or was detained by
the police which happened a little earlier?

MS MABIJA:

I think it was thirteen days because he was suppose to appear the 8th and
they brought him the 7th because he was suppose to appear the 8th. The
day he was arrested it was very early it was two oíclock or three oí
clock Iím not sure about the time but they came to knock hard on the door
and on the window. Phaki was sleeping in the front room with his brother
Themba so when he woke up we opened the door and they said they were
policemen they came in when they were inside they wanted Phaki and he
showed himself. So they got inside the house and they looked around
everywhere and they started searching the house. And they turned
everything in the house upside down and they left the house like that. So
they left with him.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, could you just tell me how long was it that he was
detained before they brought him back to search the house.

MS MABIJA:

I think it was thirteen days before, they brought him on the 7th instead
of the 8th because it was that fourteen that the police just arrested you
without telling you the reason why?

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, did you see him during those 14 days in prison?

MS MABIJA:

I saw him once but he didnít want to speak to us. When I came with my
brothers in Transvaal Road and as he came out he was unable to talk and
it seemed difficult for him to talk in front of the policemen who were
with him because he felt intimidated and it became obvious to us that he
felt threatened and intimidated by these policemen.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, can you tell me how old was he when he died?

MS MABIJA:

27 years.

DR BORAINE:

Tell us just a little bit about him, what kind of man was he?

MS MABIJA:

Phakamile was a very good child and he hated everything that was wrong.
He was a person who was involved with the scouts and church activities
and he was involved in everything. He was involved in everything, in all
the church activities, at school, sports and he was a person who wanted
the best and who was goal orientated and he committed himself in
achieving his goals. He was a person who was a visionary who channelled
all his energies to accomplish the best of things. He wanted success - he
wanted the good things to succeed. He would say "I want a plan to succeed
and when it succeeds it should benefit all". He always wanted his dreams
to come true and be successful. Everything about him was so amazing
because he was such a great person. And about the fact that he killed
himself - that is not true - there is no such a thing like that.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, was Phaki working when he was arrested and if so,
what work was he doing?

MS MABIJA:

He was a teacher at Zingisa.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you and just one last question before I ask someone else questions.
Did he belong to any political party, was he involved in politics at all?

MS MABIJA:

I donít remember but I think he was a youth (nomad?).

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, Iím going to ask some questions of Shirley Mabija
now, so if you could make sure the microphone is very close to you - pull
it very close. Ja thereís lots of room - you are Shirley Mabija. Again a
very warm word of welcome to you, I know itís not easy. Perhaps you would
tell us what you remember about those times. Sorry could you put the
light on.

MS MABIJA:

I remember the 7th of July 1977 I was with the adults and the children at
home and the two policemen Oscar Ntsiko and Du Plessis they came inside
the house with Phaki. I donít remember the colour of their car and Phaki
came and having the looks of being beaten up and he didnít have his
spectacles on, and he didnít have his belt on his pants as well. And I
didnít hear him saying anything because he was not clear in his speech.
The got inside with him and they lifted up the carpet not knowing what he
was looking for and they went in the bedroom with him. And then I came in
and asked him and I said "Phaki, would you like a cup of tea?" And Oscar
said to me "Wie het ges  ons soek tee?" at that time they went out with
him and they turned ack at the gate and came back to the house and then
they said to him "Groet jou mense want jy gaan nie vir hulle weer sien
nie. After that they left with him and that was the last time I saw Phaki
alive.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, did they find anything in the cupboard or in the
room?

MS MABIJA:

No, they found nothing.

DR BORAINE:

When they said you must greet your family because you will never see them
again, in what language was that said?

MS MABIJA:

Afrikaans.

DR BORAINE:

And can you remember - I know itís a long time ago so think carefully -
can you remember who exactly said that?

MS MABIJA:

It was Du Plessis but Iím not to sure but I think it was Du Plessis. And
Oscar was also speaking. I donít know what Oscar said but I know that Du
Plessis did say that. I was looking at Phakamile and because of doing so
I didnít have much time to listen to what the policemen were saying
because I became sick when I looked at Phakamileís face.

DR BORAINE:

Of course I can well understand that. You mentioned Oscar, is that Oscar
Ntsiko?

MS MABIJA:

Yes.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you, when did you hear about Phakiís death?

MS MABIJA:

I heard in the afternoon after my sisters came in as they told me they
have met someone who told them. And this person said to them that Phaki
died after he fell at Transvaal Road.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, what happened after that was there an inquiry or an
inquest or [indistinct] Did you attend the inquest?

MS MABIJA:

There was an inquest, we were taken I canít remember how many days after
- it was on Monday or after the funeral I canít remember but we were
taken myself and Sis Ntsiki, we were taken to Transvaal Road. We were
interviewed there. I canít tell which floor was it which policemen was it
- I canít remember at all because we just get in the building - you donít
even know which floor you are going or where you are going, they are
watching you whereever you go and they ask you that you must - dan praat
- praat - praat dan moet jy net praat. Nou ek kan rerig nie verstaan nie,
ek kon nie s  watter vloer was ek of wat nie.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, I asked your sister about your brother. Do you want
to add anything at all about who - what sort of person he was and
particular do you know if he was involved with any political party. Did
he attend party meetings, was he working for someone?



MS MABIJA:

Because I was a sick person Phaki said to me Sisi Iím in Christian, Iím
not sure, Youth. We want to go to Pietermaritzburg before he got arrested
and he said to me Sisi donít you want go with us so that we can have a
rest so that your mind can reg? And I know him as a teacher he was an
elder at the Catholic Church. He was a Scouts Commissioner. He was
everything and he was a good boy. He was helping the orphan children
within the family - our uncleís children - uncleís children who donít
have uniform - he used to buy uniform and open up accounts for them and
buy for everybody - he had a good heart. I donít know about politics, I
really donít know Iíll be telling lies. I donít know if he was in
politics I donít whether was it a PAC or an ANC I donít know a thing. I
only know him as an ordinary child - a good child - who listened to his
parents - an even though he was young I used to listen to what he was
telling me - I took him as an adult although I was older than him.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you - thank you very much, thatís very helpful. I just - can you
remember if you think back now did the police ever say why they were
taking your brother or what did they accuse him of because he was
obviously never tried - he was detained like so many other people but did
they ever say any thing about why?

MS MABIJA:

They never told us why they arrested him. Even today I want to know why
did they arrest him - what did he do - because I donít understand why did
they arrest him? I really donít know and I want to know? Even today, its
years and years but I donít understand why did they arrest him and I want
to know why did they arrest him? I want to know the reason why? Because I
can not wake him in the grave and ask him Phaki what did you do why were
you arrested? Because I donít know him as a criminal - I know him as a
child a good child who was listening to his parents - I donít know I
canít even say -even when we were young at home - when we were young and
if we donít want to go to school - and we were naughty, we sometimes
werer naughty but Phaki was straight forward the rest of his life, he was
well behaved. We used to get out of the way sometimes, Phaki was not like
that even in the township nobody can say that Phaki did a bad thing - or
if he stole something or beat somebodyís child or stab anyone - I donít
know I also want to know why he was arrested?

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much and thank you for your help. Iím going to ask
HenriÀtta Manzana just a few questions now. Ms Manzana you are a witness,
not a member of the family but a friend of the family and can you tell us
I understand that you were actually working at the Transvaal Road Police
Station where Phaki was being held. Tell us what happened and what you
saw on that day.

MS MANZANA:

I saw Phaki coming from upstairs - I first took food to him and Oscar
said I must put it down and I had (indistinct) water he was shaking and
said I must put it down he will eat when he comes back - when he comes
back from (indistinct) when he came back I saw Phaki went through the
window - they never brought him to me and they only brought him to me
knowing that I am his grandmother - Maynard (indistinct) is my sisterís
child at Empangeni - his motherís name is Mary-Jane Nomaramba - they
never told me that my sisterís child has come back - we will kill him now
- we just saw him flying from on top (indistinct) when I was sending tea
to Maynard - kyk daar is my kind hy val af - I went down trying to save
him so that he can fall on top of me - I couldnít save him. I went to him
and once said "get off there" and said "I wonít get off you can shoot me
if you want to" Oscar said on top you must die you dog Oscar Ntsiko said
you must die you dog. He stays in (indistinct).

DR BORAINE:

Thank you, thatís a very painful memory, I want to just ask a couple of
question. Ms Manzana where were you when you saw Phaki coming - falling
from the window? Where were you - inside the building, which floor were
you? Were you outside, where were you?

MS MANZANA:

I was on the third floor making tea. (indistinct)

DR BORAINE:

And which floor was he when you saw him last?

MS MANZANA:

Seven.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you, do you want to add anything at all?

MS MANZANA:

I went to Major when I was on the ground and said Major the dog is mine
the law is yours. Major asked where was he? I said he is on the ground
and we went there with Major and he saw him there and he asked who did
this and I said it is Oscar.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, I just want to give an opportunity now for the
sisters too - if thereís anything that weíve left that youíd like to add
before I hand back to the Chairperson.

MS MABIJA:

The sad thing is this - that makes my mother hurt, my mother now Ö

DR BORAINE:

Itís okay, take your time donít rush it. Perhaps a little water would
might help? Sylvia thereís no hurry at all, just take your time, we can
pause for a moment. I can ask perhaps one of the others if theyíd like to
add anything - itís up to you.

Okay Sylvia while you just recovering a little bit Iím going to ask Ms
Manzana just one last question. If you could make sure that sheís got the
microphone, Iíll come back to you in a moment, Sylvia.

Ms Manzana can you hear me all right? Thank you very much, just you
mentioned right towards the end that you had spoken to a Major. Can you
remember the Majorís name?

MS MANZANA:

I canít remember his name. He is tall - I canít remember his name.

DR BORAINE:

Do you feel you can carry on now or - youíd like to try, okay.

MS MABIJA:

Since this happened to Phaki my mother got sick - my mother canít do
nothing - sheís just a parcel - sheís got a head sickness - Iím
struggling with her because she canít sleep - she canít sleep during the
day and at night - and I go everywhere day and night - everyday in my
life - so I donít have good health - my father also died because of this
- he had a heart attack - so I would like to see the perpetrators - what
did they do - why did they kill Phaki? - Iím not in good health - I canít
have good health - if there is any help that you can do for my mother -
and to take her to the doctors so that she can be better than she is.

DR BORAINE:

You have illustrated something which we have seen so many times. That the
death of one person - the killing of one person brings so much sorrow and
grieve not only to this loss of life but also to members of the family
and you have obviously suffered very deeply as a family.

We have noted your comments about your mother and the psychiatric
treatment and we will certainly do everything we possibly can under the
circumstances.

	Can I ask you a final question is there anything else you would like the
Commission to do if the Commission was able to assist in any way?

MS MABIJA:

I would like my mother to get treatment - maybe there will be something
better because Iím not in good health - Iím also sick - at night when I
sleep I must hold her in my arms - I sleep with her - I must make sure
that she is not moving because she wakes up and wants to go out - so
there is no good health at all.

DR BORAINE:

Thank you very much, weíve also noted that you have asked us to try and
find out any details surrounding the death of your brother and we have
noted that as well. Iím going to hand back to the Chairperson in chase
any of my fellow Commissioners may which to ask any questions.

CHAIRPERSON:

Thank you very much, are there any further questions - Denzil Potgieter?

ADV POTGIETER:

Thank you Chairperson - Ms Manzana I just want to clarify your evidence.
Is it correct - do I understand it correctly that you heard at one stage
after Phaki fell - the deceased fell you heard Oscar the policeman saying
something?

MS MANZANA:

Yes - when I was on the ground floor where Phaki died - Oscar was looking
at Phaki and said you must die you dog.

ADV POTGIETER:

Sorry, before you saw the body dropping passed the window, did you hear
anything in the building?



MS MANZANA:

I didnít hear anything he just came from the top floor - I didnít hear
him crying - I didnít see him doing anything - I just dropped the tea and
went down to the ground - trying to hold Phaki - but I couldnít save him
because he was already on the ground and he was lying facing down. When I
went to him - Mtshisana said hey - and I said thatís my childís son you
can shoot me if you want to.

CHAIRPERSON:

Thank you, yes.

ADV POTGIETER:

Thank you Chairperson, perhaps Shirley could assist with this. How long
was it after the police brought Phaki home that you heard that he had
died?

MS MABIJA:

It was about an hour - if Iím not telling lies - even an hour is too long
- and we heard that he has died.

CHAIRPERSON:

We thank you. We donít know sometimes what to do because we repeating the
same thing - with things that are happening - we say weíve got the
freedom now but is the freedom that came by sacrifice of many people -
that came by broken hearts that were experienced by many people - we
thank you for giving yourselves just like Phaki because it was a long
time hearing this story of his in our church. We will try out best to
investigate this to get the truth of it so that you the family can also
forgive and you must know that he was arrested for this when he died he
died like this we say that God must strengthen you knowing that this
actions were not in vain. Thank you.











































STATEMENT - COMPLAINANT SYLVIA NONTSIKELELO MABIJA



On 27th June 1977 the police arrived at my home to search. There were
lots of them who came with SAP cars. They told us that they were looking
for Phakamile [Phaki]. At the time Phaki was asleep on the couch with his
younger brother. The police then left with him. My other brothers had
tried to visit him at the police cells at the Transvaal Road Police
Station but in vain. After some days, the 13th day of his arrest, two
policemen came with Phakamile to our house.

	It was about 14:00 when two of the policemen came home with him. The two
policemen were Oscar Ntsiko [deceased] and Van Wyk. We could see that
Phaki was in pain as he did not even want to speak to us. The police led
him to a carpet in the front room where they lifted it but there was
nothing there. He was later led out into the yard. We tried to speak to
him but he did not answer.

When they were about to leave the gate Van Wyk told Phaki to greet his
people as he would not be able to see us again. Van Wyk came in with him
but he did not say a word. They then left.

	After about 45 minutes we heard that Phaki had committed suicide. This
was unlike him as he had a strong character and he was also the community
builder. As a result of this incident his father had suffered from a
heart attack which had resulted in his death in 1983. His mother had been
affected by her sonís death to such an extend that she is an invalid. An
inquest was held but nothing come out of it.













STATEMENT COMPLAINANT - SHIRLEY MABIJA



On 7th July 1977 I was sitting with the family at 3048 Miti Street at
plus-minus 12:30 when two or three policemen arrived with Phakamile
Mabija, my brother. He did not have his specs on or his belt. His lips
looked very dry. The policemen would not let me speak to him. He said
that he did not know what they wanted from him.

The black policeman - Oscar Ntsiko and the other policeman took him
outside to the gate and then brought him back. They told him - groet jou
familie, jy gaan hulle nie weer sien nie. They then took him away.

	At 3:00pm on that same day we heard from others - [neighbours] that he
had fallen out of a 6th floor window at Transvaal Road police station.

	A white and black policeman came to tell us that he had died. Sergeant
Mkhosi was the black policeman. I donít know who the white one was.

	My brothers have more details - Themba and Abraham Mabija. The incident
was reported to the Transvaal Road police station.

























STATEMENT - COMPLAINANT MARY-JANE THEMBILE MABIJA



I was Phakamile Mabijaís cousin. Some time before his death on 7th July
1977 the police were looking for him because they suspected that he was
politically active. In June 1977 they arrested him for stone throwing at
the Recreation Centre in Thulana Street, Galeshewe. He was with other
members of various youth organisations.

	During his detention at Transvaal Road police station he was taken to
various friendís homes. The police were looking for documents. They went
to the home of Juliana Shirping - a colleague of mine and Phakamileís.

	Juliana sent for me and asked me to bring some boys to her house. She
wanted them to move a wardrobe out of the way and take Phakamileís
documents out. After a while she sent these documents to me. There were
documents/information about police organisations. I got scared and took
them to his parents home. We then realised that Phakamile was politically
active.

	On 7th July 1977 I heard that Phakamile was dead. My cousins can tell
you more. See CT/00635 and CT/00135.

























RESEARCH NOTES



Phakamile Mabija was detained on 27th June 1977 after an incident when

WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE TRC?

Find who killed our brother and get an explanation for killing him.



RESEARCH NOTES



Phakamile Mabija lived in Vergenoeg, 1038 Mintzi Street. He was the
church warden of the Galeshewe parish of St James, and a full-time youth
worker for the Anglican church. Politically he was a affiliated to the
ANC.

DEATH IN DETENTION:

Phakamile Mabija was detained on 27th June 1977 after an incident, when
busses were stoned by African and Coloured commuters during a bus boycott
in Kimberley. Phakamile was due to appear in court on 8th July 1977 under
charges - under the Riotís Assemblies Act.

	Phakamile died in detention on 7th July 1977, the day before his
scheduled court hearing. He plunged from the 6th floor of Transvaal Road
police station in Kimberley.

INQUEST:

An inquest into the death was held in August until September 1977. The
verdict was that Mabija died of multiple injuries following a jump from
the 6th floor window. Nobody was found responsible for the death. The
Magistrate was JH Booysen, his assessor was Professor JA Oliver.

WITNESSES AT THE INQUEST:

According to the Police the detainee committed suicide. Colonel JD du
Plessis, then Chief of the Kimberley Security Police, explained at the
inquest that normally all windows are locked. On that particular day he
and a Mr Van der Merwe had opened a window in Van der Merweís office to
allow fresh air in. Sergeant Oscar Ntsiko explained that he escorted the
detainee from the toilet, when Mabija suddenly broke loose and ran into
Van der Merweís office. He rushed after him, only to see the detainee
crash through the window. Du Plessis and Van der Merwe were in the office
at the time. The Head of the Security Police in the Northern Cape read
from an alleged ANC pamphlet that urged detainees to commit suicide.
Lieutenant CHE van Wyk told the Court that he had instructed Sergeant
Ntsiko and Constable MG Matsheka to take Mr Mabija home to fetch a
document.

	The deceasedís mother Dora Mabija told the inquest court that during his
detention her son was taken back home to look for a document. When this
was not found a white detective had said to her son, say goodbye to your
family, you will not see them again, Colonel Du Plessis disputed this
statement.

	The district surgeon Dr TC Robertson identified a fractured skull as a
cause of death. In addition the independent pathologist, Dr BA Mahler,
said Mabija had cuts on his face, hands and liver. The cuts on his hands
could have been caused by clutching glass. Lacerations of the liver could
have been caused by assault.

LAWYERS:

Mabija family:			Jack Unterhalter, SC instructed by

Robert Sobukwe.

Commissioner of Police: 	CF van der Heever, instructed by

Deputy State Attorney.

OTHER POSSIBLE CONTACTS

The very reverend Tom Stanage, vicar-general of the diocese of Kimberley
and Kuruman.

ALLEGED PERPETRATORS:

Many allegations of torture involve Transvaal Road police station.
Accused and witnesses of the Kimberley Terrorism Trial 1982-83 were
mainly held at this police station. They reported several incidents of
torture to the Court. Cases involving the alleged tortures of Phaki are
as follows:

* Moetie Diseko [21] [460 Malata Street, no 2 Galeshewe] told the Court
  about being tortured and said that he often heard people crying out in
  pain in adjoining rooms at the Transvaal Road police station - [Diamond
  Fields Advertiser, 5th August 1982]
* Benjamin Lesego Swarts [20] was allegedly assaulted by six men,
  including Warrant Officers Du Plessis, Van der Colff and Topkins. Mr
  Van der Heever, Captain Van Wyk and Kiewiet [Diamond Fields Advertiser,
  10th August 1982]

Mr Luthando Charlie [from Vergenoeg]] was collected by Captain C van Wyk,
Sergeant Du Plessis, and a Van der Merwe and later assaulted. Captain Van
Wyk threatened to re-arrest him if he revealed anything that happened to
him.

* Hope Thsepo Chiwa [21] [3148 Matanzima Street, Vergenoeg] told the
  Court that while he was questioned he heard screaming - sounding like
  Joey Kers - on the 6th floor of the Transvaal Road police station. On
  10th or 11th February 1980[?] Chiwa himself was allegedly assaulted by
  Captain Van Wyk, Du Plessis and Kiewiet van Heerden [Diamond Fields
  Advertiser 17th - 19th August 1982]
* Mr Lucky Daniel Goalathwe Mokubung [19] [1962 Mandi Road, Galeshewe]
  told the Court that during questioning by the Security Police he was
  assaulted by amongst others Captain Van Wyk.
* Newspaper articles reporting on the Terrorism Trial refer to a
  Sergeant and a Warrant Officer Du Plessis. Sources about Phakamile
  Mabija refer to a Colonel Du Plessis. It needs to be established
  whether this is the same person.
