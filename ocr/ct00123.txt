ABDUL GANIE ALLIE			Duly sworn states

ABDURAMAN ALLIE			Duly sworn states

COMMISSIONER: Thank you, you may be seated.Commissioner Glenda Wilschut
will facilitate your evidence and I hand over to her.

MS WILDSCUT: Thank you Denzil, I was about to say good morning, but I was
just reminded that it is now afternoon.Mr Allie, Mr Abdul Allie because
you are the person who has given us the statement, I would like you to
speak to us first, after you have given us your statement, I will ask
your brother Mr Hassan Allie, just to add very briefly to what you have
told us.Would you please start off by telling us who you are, just a
little bit about yourself and then you are free to proceed and tell us
your story in your own words, thank you very much.

ABDUL GANIE ALLIE: Okay my name is Abdul Ganie Allie and normally I am
know as Ganie, so I'd like the Commission as if they would call me Ganie
please.

MS WILDSCHUT: Certainly we'll respect that. --- Where do I start, I am a
qualified teacher as well as a counseling psychologist and I work at an
institution where we rehabilitate juvenile offenders.I am married and I
have three children and they all going to school, their ages range
between 9 and 5 at the moment.My wife is at home, and I was suppose to be
at work today but because of the happenings here, I had to come and
testify.

	You are the brother to Abdurahman Allie about whom you are going to tell
us. --- Yes Abdurahman was our youngest brother who was killed in 1976.

	Yes you may proceed with the story now. --- Okay the incident happened
quite a while ago in fact twenty years this coming September.It was in
the month of fasting that it occurred, I was at work on the day and at
the moment I am living in Heathfield, but when this thing occurred it
happened in Ravensmead where my parents were staying.On the 7th of
September 1976 there was for lack of a better word, there was rioting
taking place in Ravensmead or a up rise taking place in Ravensmead and I
was at work the morning and heard about this.But because I didn't think
it would affect us, I stayed until the end of the day and my brother
Hassan next to me, collected me at work and we came home around about six
o'clock the evening.At sunset we - we had our meal on the way home, when
we turned into De la Ray Road off Modderdam Road, we were stopped by the
police and said we couldn't enter the area.We said no but we live in the
area and we are on our way home, they eventually allowed us to proceed
and we had to drive through barricades etcetera and we got home a couple
of minutes later.The area was in turmoil and there was tires and stuff
burning.We went inside and we had our meals and it was - it was very
risky being outside and we lived where my mother use to living at the
moment for those who don't know the area, on the road leading to
Tygerberg Hospital, now we were living on the border between let's put it
this way, the so-called white area and we were living on the border there
where - in the non-white area.So the people were - were assembling where
we were staying and whatever was going on outside, we could be held
accountable for that.On the other side you had the whites standing and on
the border on this side, we had the so-called let's say non-whites
accumulating there, throwing stones whatever.And we noticed what was
happening, okay eventually to cut a long story short, it was peaceful and
quite after that.At about ten o'clock that night, we were all in the
house, we had a cup of tea and I distinctly remember the time because I
use to listen to a radio serial at the time.And I went out the back door
I use to do it, because I was studying and I thought I'll take a bit of
fresh air, when from the back door to the front of our house, there were
some white people about 200 meters away standing on the opposite and I
was wondering why they were standing there, because there was nothing
happening and why didn't they then go home, maybe to them it was - it was
fun to stand outside and watch other people being assaulted or what or
being shoot - shot at.A while later he came - Hassan came out and my
later brother also joined me and were standing on our premises inside the
yard and there was - and God is my witness, there was no-one apart from
our opposite neighbour who was also standing and watching what was going
on, because we live there, where else do we have to go and
stand.Eventually after five minutes or so, I decided look there is
nothing going on, I am going inside.He remained behind Hassan remained
behind with Abdurahman, still on the premises and I went back into the
house.And I was not - I was about to touch the handle - but bear in mind
there was no-one in sight in front where we were staying.And as I touched
the door handle, I just heard gunshots, I mean immediately I thought
what's happening, who's shooting, why are they shooting? But before I
could do anything, he came running down the driveway, ran into the garage
I think and I called out to him or he called out to me where is
Abdurahman so he says he was lying on the floor of the garage.So
Abdurahman apparently manage to run down the lane, but what we didn't
know was that more or less a position where - where the Commissioners are
sitting now, more or less, maybe a meter or two further back, there is a
wall at our place, exactly the same height.And our opposite neighbour who
also gave a statement Ms Adams, apparently saw the police hiding behind
that wall, while I was standing there, and they were actually as I went
out, they jumped up and they just shot at us.Ms Adams before they fired
-tried to phone us to say listen we didn't get the call, maybe because we
were outside obviously we couldn't hear the phone ringing, but perhaps
someone inside didn't think it was - I don't suppose there was enough
time - was in a shock - but by the time I touched the handle and I came
back, all of a sudden there was -there were policeman where they came
from heaven knows.And they shot Abdurahman I mean four of them I would
like to if I may I handed the names in to the Commission, I am going to
mention their names, because I feel and maybe I am jumping the gun here
because in the inquest that followed, it was found and I have it here, no
blame on rioters death, where they said, nobody could be held accountable
for his death, yet four people shot an unarmed young man, in front of us
for no reason whatsoever, and I mean he died instantly and the people who
shot him, had the audacity to make a case against us and two weeks later
myself and my brother was locked up and we were charged with public
violence.And they concocted evidence and they got people to testify
against us that I was there the whole day for heaven's sake how can I be
at two places at the same time when I was at work, I had to get the place
where I was working somebody to testify in Court for us that I was not
there the whole day.I mean I wasn't even there the whole day, I got there
as six o'clock and we were made out to be liars.But okay we somehow
managed to get the money together, we got donations from the World
Council of Churches we had to raise funds by having film shows to defend
us against the perpetrators whom I am going to mention now.And I am
quoting from the newspaper of 1976, the riot policeman who were involved
in the shooting was Lieutenant Hendrik Haarhof, Constable Johannes Botha,
Jacques Gideon Tredoux, and Dewald van der Berg.And they alleged they
were shooting at rioters.When if I may continue... [intervention]

	Ja if I can just ask you if you would make the copy of that paper
available to the Commission please. --- I have given - I have given
copies of all this to the Commission.

	Thank you very much. --- The next day okay when they shot Abdurahman, we
carried him into the - into our kitchen, my parents were sleeping it was
ten o'clock.These policeman came running down our driveway now as I said
I was about to enter the house, before I could enter one of them hit me
on the - on the side of the head, I mean I was standing in the back of
our yard, I don't know why he hit me, they came running down, clubbed me
with the butt of the gun, despite that I was kneeling down to pick my
brother up, and they actually wanted to just drag him outside like a dog
and I am sorry to use that term to refer to my brother.Okay we then told
them but we live on this premises, we have to be here, where do you
expect us to be, so we managed to convince them to allow us to take him
inside our kitchen, he was lying there mortally wounded, we didn't
realize it was like that.There was nobody outside, there was no so-called
rioters -rioting outside.Immediately when we got in my mother got in, my
father got there and I mean they were in tears what's happening now who
shoot - who shot this young man.I went in to go and phone the ambulance
because we had to get him to a hospital, as I phoned this - the ambulance
or the doctor - this one policeman who shot our youngest - our brother
said in Afrikaans what have we done, as if he regrets it, because they
now realized but they shot someone wrongfully.Eventually the ambulance
came, they put him on a stretcher we have some photo's here which I also
handed in, and they took him to Tygerberg Hospital.I went with, they put
a patch of plaster on my - on my - on the side of my head here and he was
certified dead on arrival.We weren't allowed to take the body home
because in terms of our faith we need to bury him the next day.No
permission was granted by us to perform a post-mortem, they simply put
him another ambulance and took him to the State Mortuary, we had no
rights, we couldn't even take him home to give him a decent burial.The
next day we had the funeral and the mourners who attended in fact they
were so - so rude they even fired on the mourners who was standing there
the next day at about twelve - one 'clock to attend the funeral.The
funeral was held I - it was - it was a very tragic moment in our lives, I
mean I could - it was the first time somebody had died in our family, and
one can imagine the trauma that we had to go through - I personally had
to go through because I still today feel that if I didn't go that night,
maybe it would never have happened.I mean I didn't mean to go out to get
him killed.But I didn't know there were people sitting there who was
going to stand up, I have a picture here of my brother I just want to
show it to - to the Commissioners to think that they would shoot someone
- I'd like the photo back, it's the only one I have at the moment, to
think they would shoot someone like that - who in fact never harmed
anyone.The Commissioners came to our house to speak to my mother, I went
to see her on Sunday and she is not in a state to testify in front of
this Commission.I am a psychologist, but you give me the answers how you
overcome this problem.Because nothing in the world can bring him back.In
the meantime my late father passed away a couple of years later, I can
imagine he died a very unhappy man.But that's not the end of it because a
week or two later the police came and they surrounded our house many of
them came.And they went through every single - they went into the roofs,
they went through the entire house looking for bombs and what have you as
if we - and I must be honest enough to say I am not a political - I
wasn't a politically minded person at the time, I was studying and what
have you, my father was in the business.And we were not politically
minded people although we knew that - what was going on in the country
obviously in most if you were one of the oppressed communities and even
if you weren't one, you knew that apartheid was wrong, but I suppose we
left it to those who were very actively involved.But all of a sudden we
became I am sorry if I am deviating now, but we became the so-called
enemy heaven knows why because the police use to come around to us and
now all of a sudden when this happened we now became the enemy.They
surrounded the place, they were looking for bombs and I don't know what
else, they found absolutely nothing.So they left, the locked the entire
place and they left, okay afterwards we opened.Two weeks later I was at
work and a policeman rocks up there and said I am being charged now with
public violence.They'd already been to him, I said look you can't take me
in I am - I first want to get home, I drove with my car to my parent's
place, I was still living with them at the time, and I said look they say
we are now under arrest and we must go with themto the police station.We
said okay we'll go with you, we didn't know what we were letting
ourselves in for, when we got to the police station, they said now we
must take your fingerprints, they took our fingerprints, bear in mind
this is the month of fasting hey.And then all of a sudden they said well
you must go in, they going to lock us up now.We being charged formally
with public violence, this is two weeks after the incident.We had to
spent the whole night in jail, no food no nothing, my parents were upset
I mean you can imagine what was happening.They tried to sent us food,
instead they - they only allowed us to get coats, warm coats to keep us
warm.The next morning my - my late dad had to get legal advice in order
to get us out on bail.Fortunately family members came with and they gave
moral support and we were then formally charged in Court in Parow, the
case was then transferred to Bellville - we were out on bail of R400-00
each, both of us, and it became a formal hearing.And for that I don't
know how many months the case dragged on, we were going through that
trauma of being charged with public violence, we had to appear every time
there was a Court hearing we had to appear, we had to get an attorney,
the attorney advised us to get an advocate, and we had to get a junior
advocate, the system apparently works like that, which all cost money and
we didn't have all that kind of money, yet we had to defend ourselves.The
State at the time, this was in the prime years of apartheid could go
indefinitely, I was forced to - I was ten - I was teaching at the school
and fortunately I could - we could raise funds try to get some funds to
pay the legal fees.We wrote to the World Council of Churce’s they donated
some I think in the region of R2,000-00 plus to us, which we really
appreciated at the time.I can't remember the person in charge name, but
any case, but anyway, to cut a long story short, in the end they found us
- they acquitted us for lack of evidence.

	It's okay Mr Hassan Allie, we'll give you an opportunity to speak after
your brother has addressed the Commission.--- We were then acquitted, now
subsequent to that they had - we again had to raise money to have the
inquest, so we had to get another advocate to attend to the inquest.And
to summarize the inquest found that nobody was responsible for his death,
nobody - somebody shot him, four people shot at him at one person and
they - we have photo's here of how he was - his body was mutilated at a
distance of about five - six metres if he was doing something wrong,
which I still maintain to this day then surely they should of arrested
him and the three of us then and put us in jail.I would of accepted that
if we were doing something wrong, normally they would - they would have
to but obviously they were out - the intention was to kill someone.But to
have taken it out on our young brother, I still don't understand.We left
it like that because when we were acquitted it was like an anti climax
now why did you let us go through all this trauma, why did you charge us,
if we are innocent.After the inquest again nobody was held responsible
and we had to console ourselves, we had to pacify ourselves and my
parents had to live with the loss of a young son who was I mean he had
the technical ability to have been I don't know, God determines how long
we going to live on this world, it's not in our hands, but for someone to
suddenly come and terminate your life just like that for no reason
whatsoever, that to me is totally unacceptable and there was no apology
from the State from nobody not from one of these policeman came to our
place to apologize and up until this moment I - I don't wish to raise the
issue with my mother even when I decided to follow this - we decided to
come to the Commission, I didn't have the guts to go to my mother even
when I saw on Sunday to tell her I just told her I am going to the
Commission, that's all.

	Can you tell us how old your brother was at the time you referred to him
as a young man, how old was he at the time? --- He was - he was 21 years
old.

	21. --- 21 yes.

	Apart from yourselves asbrothers and your parents did he have any other
family? --- No he wasn't married at the time, he was assisting my parents
at home and he had his own business in electronics, radio fixing etcetera
and I suppose had he been alive today he would have been doing the kind
of work that the gentleman over there is probably doing or something like
that, but I can't ... [intervention]

	You referring to the technician when you pointing. --- Ja he was - he
was very electronically minded at one stage he had his own, I would call
it a disco band or whatever but something in sound system what have
you.But he was - he was quite talented from a technical point of view.

	Maybe we can ask your brother Mr Hassan Allie now to address us, he - I
am sure Mr Allie would like to add to your statement.We are aware that we
do not have a statement, a written statement before us, so we would ask
if he would talk to us adding what you have said, and just perhaps to
address us quite briefly. --- Sure I just want the ask the Commission if
I could say something after that as well if I may be allowed to.

	Certainly - certainly we still need to ask a few questions for clarity
and so we'll certainly give you an opportunity to make a further
statement.

HASSAN ALLIE: --- Good afternoon ladies and gentleman my name is Hasson
Allie I am the eldest brother of the late Abdurahman Allie.The place
where we use to work in - during the incident of 1976, the 7th of
September my brother Ganie was working at Standard Bank and I was working
as Spes Bona Bank before they became First National or Barclays.We are
business people, we were reared behind the counter, there was no such a
thing as political inclement, although we always supported the
underprivileged.I am sitting in front of here because I did speak to Dr
Wendy Orr and Ms Mary Burton up till today I can't see myself looking at
my brother's photo and say there's nothing I could you for you my
friend.He turned 21 at the age, a prime age, he became a sponsor for
Caltex Electronics which could have been a viable proposition for him to
the future if he had lived.But as my brother said we don't know how long
we will live.As Ganie had confirmed that there was no riots at the time
between eight and ten when we usually close the shop.Also our neighbour
Ms Adams confirmed that with your investigation, and it was during the
time of Ramadaan.Losing a brother is a big thing, it is something which
you cannot imagine yourself unless you have the family with you, nobody
else can feel it for you.To be locked up during Ramadaan, without food
because we normally fast from the morning till sunset, and we were picked
up at three o'clock the afternoon and to go without food until the next
day is 48 hours.And yet when a policeman came to the cell, when I held
him because he was of - he couldn't think why we were locked up, we were
asked why are you in jail, what have you stolen, you pigs, have you
stolen pigs?What can you do, you sit and look at the policeman your
brother had just died, your mother - father had a heart attack after
that, you sit and think what must you do, must you go out and revenge
him, is that the thing God has given us to revenge each other.Yet at the
inquest when our advocate Mr Blignault asked the constable how did you
feel why did you shoot, I mean how long were you on duty, he just said
I've - I intend to kill and as he said in the inquest, after being found
not guilty by Judge Symington, we asked the Magistrate but why, I mean we
were acquitted why aren't they charged for murder.We were just told you
can - you'll be held in contempt by asking a question to the Magistrate
why is no-one to blame.What do you do in that instance, you go and report
an incident at the police station, you get held up in a cell for the same
day on the funeral, and told look if you don't sign a statement, we will
do what we did to your brother.The name of the Captain was Captain
Potgieter, the other day whilst I - I went to Ms Burton and Dr Wendy Orr
I said to them I went to get a sworn affidavit because I do - I am in
real estate I have to get certain documents signed by Commissioners on
the sworn affidavits, I met this Constable in the Court, I looked at him,
I said to myself how can I forgive him, burly, brave he walks down the
Courts of today's law.Where is justice, do we have to do what happened on
Sunday night, take the guns and go and shoot them is that the kind of a
justice system which I am now forced to say I'd like to do it but I can't
because I am a God fearing person.Please look at the evidence, look at
the statements which has been delivered and the Court results and the
inquest, see what you can do for me, not to satisfy me, but to satisfy
the justice and the legal system of today.Thank youYour Honour.

	Thank you Mr Allie, your brother was wanting to make a further statement
before we ask questions for clarification.

ABDUL GANIE ALLIE: Thank you Commissioner Wildschut, I don't know whether
you want to have the order the other way around, you first want to ask
questions and then I can.

	I just have one or two questions, it seems as though your -as you tell
your testimony that the family has gone through repeated harassment since
that incident and your family has gone through a tremendous amount of
trauma.And I am very aware that - that there are many questions
unanswered in this whole incident.Could you give us an idea of how the
family as a unit - did the family have coped with these tragic events,
how have -how has the family death with this event? --- Thank you Ms
Wildschut I just want to say since the incident the family hasn't coped
in fact the family has - have split up.Because Abdurahman was - he was
the one unifying factor in our family.I think he was the one was - who
could have carried on but sadly he was taken out of circulation.And I
suppose we all have our own lives to lead, and I - I got married, I have
my own family to look after not that I don't care about the rest of the
family.But with - with Abdurahman if he had remained behind he could of -
I think he would of carried on, but as it is now, nobody has carried on
and I think we all got stuck in 1976 because of the severe blow to the
family.My mother I don't think she's come over this - this hurdle.

	Has - I know you're a mental health practitioner yourself, has the
family had an opportunity to have any supportive counseling perhaps not
in the - perhaps in the traditional sense of counseling but in which ever
way the family feels is necessary, has there been any external support
for the family/Not on a formal basis but on a - let's say friends/family
basis, we've had the prayer evenings, the 40-days - 100-days annually
we've had it for initially we've had it every year etcetera prayer
evenings and that is one way to console the family.We have accepted the
loss, we have accepted the fact that he has departed from this world.I
think it's the manner in which he departed from this world that is so
unacceptable to us that there is never been any attempt from those who -
who took him away, who came to us and who apologized - had they
apologized or even in any way, approached my late father or us in fact
and my mother, to say look we acted on - purely on instinct or whatever,
I know it was a difficult situation at the time, but it does - it didn't
warrant that kind of action from anyone, lest alone - least of all
against the person like - like my brother.And I am not trying to paint a
picture here of an angel, he was a young man, he was liked by everyone.He
hardly had time to get his life going, yet he was shot down in the prime
of his life, we have photo's here as to how they shot him front and back,
he body was mutilated to the extend that it was - it was horrible to look
at him.I couldn't bear to look at him the day of the funeral, but there
was no counseling to answer your question except the fact that we - we
had to console ourselves.

	Ja, through the hearings that we have been going through the past few
months, and also this week, the notion has come up that we need many more
centres and places where people who have been traumatized by events like
the one you described can be taken through counseling, can be supported
and help to deal with the past, so that we can move into the future.Would
you support such a notion? --- Are you referring to my family as well?

	Yes I am. --- I think I am in favour of that yes, I would support that,
thank you.

	Thank you very much, I do not have any more questions to ask you except
to hand over to the chair and perhaps if any of my colleagues would like
to ask some questions. --- Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, any further questions, Mary Burton.

MS BURTON: Thank you, thank you Chairperson, it's perhaps not exactly a
question, I would just like to say that, that Wendy and I remember very
vividly the discussions that we had with Mr Hassan Allie and the - the
picture is certainly one of frustration and rage at a quest for justice
which met closed doors everywhere and we really understand that sense of
wanting to find answers, wanting to find explanations.And we hope that
through this process, you will at least make one step further forward in
that guest.And also just to remind the audience and all of us that, that
period of the - that week in September was a time of great turbulence in
Cape Town.There was - there had been - the schools had been closed and
there were various incidents of rioting and unrest which was very
strongly repressed.And in fact between the 7th and the 11th of September
the official death toll was 33 persons, it's just to get a sense for
ourselves of what that period was like.And you as a family experienced it
very tragically indeed.And so I think we particularly like to thank you
for putting yourselves through the pain of telling the story which is one
way of making sure that the record is complete.Thank you very much. ---
Okay.

CHAIRPERSON: Yes I - I want to say thank you to both of you, what has
often happened is that we tend to turn and maybe this is how we cope when
you - when you deal with tragic events, you turn the person's into
statistics, you see I mean 33 people - 33 people were killed whatever and
for most of us those are syfers I mean it is figures and maybe that is
the way you can cope because if you turn those figures into persons of
flesh and blood, that it was a brother of two people, it was the son of
and that, that death was one that triggered heart attacks for
parents.There is a level at which I think we might not always be able to
cope, and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in part is saying to
our nation these were not just statistics, these were people.People who
are remembered with deep fondness and there is still a void in the family
- in the hearts of many that we looking at all of this I mean you know
you look at forced removed and we are told 3 million people, 3½ million
people were removed.I think you are able to cope because it's numbers,
it's' when you then meet somebody from District Six who tells you that,
that is where I come from, or you are like the old man who having been
moved from District Six packed up all of this stuff in cartons, and
twenty years later when we visited him, his stuff was still in cartons
because he could not bear to unpack.And we hope I mean that as we listen
to these and other stories, that we enflesh the figures and make us aware
that we are talking about human beings.And that maybe - we ought to learn
as a nation to weep, and say this has happened in our land, and then give
thanks to God that people go around saying yes I remember you, you shot
my brother and I am going to fix you up.Because that is the - that is the
wonder of this land.It is part of the miracle of it and we want to thank
you as we thank the many who have survived these atrocities.And who have
helped or helping to transform, to change - to change what should be hate
into love and to change what ought to be turmoil and unrest into - into
peace.And we are seeing it happening in this land and you have made a
contribution to we - what we have.And yes I mean you - it's tough but
when you - when you say I mean we've got a freedom.You should know that
your brother contributed to it, and maybe that is one way that you can
come to terms with it, that it is - it is part of the price of us now
being a democracy, that your brother died yes, and died an awful death
but it was not ultimatly in vain, those who killed him at the time
thought that they would get rid of this longing for freedom, and they
thought but in killing him they would snuff him out like you snuff out a
candle.But you see in your heart and in the hearts of those who knew your
brother he lives, and he lives in the freedom of this land, that - that
blood as we have sometimes said in the rallies, in the funerals, that's
the blood that has watered the tree of freedom.And in the Christian
calendar today it is the feast of the transfiguration - a feast who
speaks about how God turns evil into God.Your brother's death was an evil
as it happened, but in a wonderful way that we cannot explain God has
used it for the sake of this land.Which does not mean that we as a
Commission must not try to find out because you want to know the truth, I
mean why it is happened.And is it possible that those who perpetrated for
whatever reason, might find it in themselves to be able to say
sorry.Thank you. --- Thank you Chairperson.Could I address the Commission
again.

	Ja. --- I wish to thank Archbishop Desmond Tutu for those kind words, I
said I just want - I just wish to thank Archbishop Tutu for those kind
words, thank you very much, that's most heartening to hear those kind
words coming from you.Thank you once again.As I said earlier on I just
wanted to say a few things if I may, I wrote something down last night
which I felt I would like to - to say to the Commission and I hope I am
not going to offend the Commission or anyone present here.Today, this
next September it's going to be 20 years since the death of my brother
and we are still mourning the loss.We still wonder why they killed him,
and why they charged us two weeks after his death and we were left
defenseless at the height of the apartheid era.We were helpless while the
trumped up every false evidence against us, producing incriminating
so-called evidence that wasn't remotely near the truth.And humiliating us
prior to the trial and even during it.I also wish to quote from the
Sunday Times of 9/6/96 with reference to a previous person who was
killed, true or not the image of my brother - brother's untimely death
has plagued our family especially my mother and my late father who
subsequently died for the past twenty years.Like so many others, she -
this is my mother is looking not for revenge so much as understanding,
but for something or someone to forgive. What happened to her son, and
why did it happen.And I am quoting this and forgive me if I am saying
this, there is little real prospect that justice will be done via the
Truth Commission, and I say this with the greatest of respect for the
Commission.I am quoting this, that justice will be done via the Truth
Commission and even less one might venture via the Courts.All we ask is
our brother's - we want our brother's name to be cleared whilst our
mother is at least still with us.And to those who unceremoniously and
cold bloodaly shot and killed him, may they find peace in their hearts.We
trust that the TRC, the Commission will fulfill it's terms of reference
and I would like to make a personal appeal to the TRC to refer this
matter to the reparations sub-committee for further attention, I thank
you very much.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. --- Thank you.
